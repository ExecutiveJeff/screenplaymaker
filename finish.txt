BEGIN NOW Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of END
BEGIN NOW lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. END
BEGIN NOW A yellow dressinggown, END
BEGIN NOW ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW held the bowl aloft and intoned: END
BEGIN NOW —Introibo ad altare Dei. END
BEGIN NOW Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: END
BEGIN NOW —Come up, Kinch! END
BEGIN NOW Come up, you fearful jesuit! END
BEGIN NOW Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. END
BEGIN NOW He faced about END
BEGIN NOW and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the END
BEGIN NOW awaking mountains. END
BEGIN NOW Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent END
BEGIN NOW towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat END
BEGIN NOW and shaking his head. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his END
BEGIN NOW arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking END
BEGIN NOW gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light END
BEGIN NOW untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the END
BEGIN NOW bowl smartly. END
BEGIN NOW —Back to barracks! END
BEGIN NOW he said sternly. END
BEGIN NOW He added in a preacher's tone: END
BEGIN NOW —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and END
BEGIN NOW blood and ouns. END
BEGIN NOW Slow music, please. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes, gents. END
BEGIN NOW One moment. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW little trouble about those white corpuscles. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, all. END
BEGIN NOW He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused END
BEGIN NOW awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there END
BEGIN NOW with gold points. END
BEGIN NOW Chrysostomos. END
BEGIN NOW Two strong shrill whistles answered END
BEGIN NOW through the calm. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. END
BEGIN NOW That will do nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Switch off the END
BEGIN NOW current, will you? END
BEGIN NOW He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering END
BEGIN NOW about his legs the loose folds of his gown. END
BEGIN NOW The plump shadowed face and END
BEGIN NOW sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. END
BEGIN NOW A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. END
BEGIN NOW —The mockery of it! END
BEGIN NOW he said gaily. END
BEGIN NOW Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! END
BEGIN NOW He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, END
BEGIN NOW laughing to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily END
BEGIN NOW halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as END
BEGIN NOW he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and END
BEGIN NOW lathered cheeks and neck. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on. END
BEGIN NOW —My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. END
BEGIN NOW But it has a END
BEGIN NOW Hellenic ring, hasn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW must go to Athens. END
BEGIN NOW Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out END
BEGIN NOW twenty quid? END
BEGIN NOW He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: END
BEGIN NOW —Will he come? END
BEGIN NOW The jejune jesuit! END
BEGIN NOW Ceasing, he began to shave with care. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, my love? END
BEGIN NOW —How long is Haines going to stay in this tower? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW —God, isn't he dreadful? END
BEGIN NOW he said frankly. END
BEGIN NOW A ponderous Saxon. END
BEGIN NOW He thinks END
BEGIN NOW you're not a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW God, these bloody English! END
BEGIN NOW Bursting with money END
BEGIN NOW and indigestion. END
BEGIN NOW Because he comes from Oxford. END
BEGIN NOW You know, Dedalus, you END
BEGIN NOW have the real Oxford manner. END
BEGIN NOW He can't make you out. END
BEGIN NOW O, my name for you END
BEGIN NOW is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade. END
BEGIN NOW He shaved warily over his chin. END
BEGIN NOW —He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is END
BEGIN NOW his guncase? END
BEGIN NOW —A woful lunatic! END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Were you in a funk? END
BEGIN NOW —I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. END
BEGIN NOW Out here in the dark END
BEGIN NOW with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a END
BEGIN NOW black panther. END
BEGIN NOW You saved men from drowning. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a hero, however. END
BEGIN NOW If END
BEGIN NOW he stays on here I am off. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. END
BEGIN NOW He hopped down END
BEGIN NOW from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. END
BEGIN NOW —Scutter! END
BEGIN NOW he cried thickly. END
BEGIN NOW He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper END
BEGIN NOW pocket, said: END
BEGIN NOW —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a END
BEGIN NOW dirty crumpled handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. END
BEGIN NOW Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: END
BEGIN NOW —The bard's noserag! END
BEGIN NOW A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. END
BEGIN NOW You can almost taste it, can't you? END
BEGIN NOW He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair END
BEGIN NOW oakpale hair stirring slightly. END
BEGIN NOW —God! END
BEGIN NOW he said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet END
BEGIN NOW mother? END
BEGIN NOW The snotgreen sea. END
BEGIN NOW The scrotumtightening sea. END
BEGIN NOW Epi oinopa ponton. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! END
BEGIN NOW I must teach you. END
BEGIN NOW You must read them in the END
BEGIN NOW original. END
BEGIN NOW Thalatta! END
BEGIN NOW Thalatta! END
BEGIN NOW She is our great sweet mother. END
BEGIN NOW Come and END
BEGIN NOW look. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Leaning on it he looked END
BEGIN NOW down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of END
BEGIN NOW Kingstown. END
BEGIN NOW —Our mighty mother! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's END
BEGIN NOW face. END
BEGIN NOW —The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That's why she won't END
BEGIN NOW let me have anything to do with you. END
BEGIN NOW —Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. END
BEGIN NOW —You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked END
BEGIN NOW you, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm hyperborean as much as you. END
BEGIN NOW But to think of END
BEGIN NOW your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for END
BEGIN NOW her. END
BEGIN NOW And you refused. END
BEGIN NOW There is something sinister in you.... END
BEGIN NOW He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. END
BEGIN NOW A tolerant END
BEGIN NOW smile curled his lips. END
BEGIN NOW —But a lovely mummer! END
BEGIN NOW he murmured to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, the loveliest END
BEGIN NOW mummer of them all! END
BEGIN NOW He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against END
BEGIN NOW his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. END
BEGIN NOW Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Silently, in END
BEGIN NOW a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its END
BEGIN NOW loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her END
BEGIN NOW breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of END
BEGIN NOW wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a END
BEGIN NOW great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. END
BEGIN NOW The ring of bay and END
BEGIN NOW skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. END
BEGIN NOW A bowl of white china had END
BEGIN NOW stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had END
BEGIN NOW torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, poor dogsbody! END
BEGIN NOW he said in a kind voice. END
BEGIN NOW I must give you a shirt and END
BEGIN NOW a few noserags. END
BEGIN NOW How are the secondhand breeks? END
BEGIN NOW —They fit well enough, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. END
BEGIN NOW —The mockery of it, he said contentedly. END
BEGIN NOW Secondleg they should be. END
BEGIN NOW God END
BEGIN NOW knows what poxy bowsy left them off. END
BEGIN NOW I have a lovely pair with a hair END
BEGIN NOW stripe, grey. END
BEGIN NOW You'll look spiffing in them. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not joking, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW look damn well when you're dressed. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanks, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW I can't wear them if they are grey. END
BEGIN NOW —He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW Etiquette is etiquette. END
BEGIN NOW He kills his mother but he can't wear grey END
BEGIN NOW trousers. END
BEGIN NOW He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the END
BEGIN NOW smooth skin. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its END
BEGIN NOW smokeblue mobile eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says END
BEGIN NOW you have g. END
BEGIN NOW p. END
BEGIN NOW i. END
BEGIN NOW He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. END
BEGIN NOW General END
BEGIN NOW paralysis of the insane! END
BEGIN NOW He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad END
BEGIN NOW in sunlight now radiant on the sea. END
BEGIN NOW His curling shaven lips laughed and END
BEGIN NOW the edges of his white glittering teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Laughter seized all his strong END
BEGIN NOW wellknit trunk. END
BEGIN NOW —Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by END
BEGIN NOW a crooked crack. END
BEGIN NOW Hair on end. END
BEGIN NOW As he and others see me. END
BEGIN NOW Who chose this END
BEGIN NOW face for me? END
BEGIN NOW This dogsbody to rid of vermin. END
BEGIN NOW It asks me too. END
BEGIN NOW —I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW It does her END
BEGIN NOW all right. END
BEGIN NOW The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW Lead END
BEGIN NOW him not into temptation. END
BEGIN NOW And her name is Ursula. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. END
BEGIN NOW If END
BEGIN NOW Wilde were only alive to see you! END
BEGIN NOW Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: END
BEGIN NOW —It is a symbol of Irish art. END
BEGIN NOW The cracked lookingglass of a servant. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him END
BEGIN NOW round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he END
BEGIN NOW had thrust them. END
BEGIN NOW —It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? END
BEGIN NOW he said kindly. END
BEGIN NOW God END
BEGIN NOW knows you have more spirit than any of them. END
BEGIN NOW Parried again. END
BEGIN NOW He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW cold steel pen. END
BEGIN NOW —Cracked lookingglass of a servant! END
BEGIN NOW Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs END
BEGIN NOW and touch him for a guinea. END
BEGIN NOW He's stinking with money and thinks you're END
BEGIN NOW not a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus END
BEGIN NOW or some bloody swindle or other. END
BEGIN NOW God, Kinch, if you and I could only END
BEGIN NOW work together we might do something for the island. END
BEGIN NOW Hellenise it. END
BEGIN NOW Cranly's arm. END
BEGIN NOW His arm. END
BEGIN NOW —And to think of your having to beg from these swine. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the only one END
BEGIN NOW that knows what you are. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you trust me more? END
BEGIN NOW What have you up END
BEGIN NOW your nose against me? END
BEGIN NOW Is it Haines? END
BEGIN NOW If he makes any noise here I'll END
BEGIN NOW bring down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave END
BEGIN NOW Clive Kempthorpe. END
BEGIN NOW Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. END
BEGIN NOW Palefaces: END
BEGIN NOW they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. END
BEGIN NOW O, I shall END
BEGIN NOW expire! END
BEGIN NOW Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! END
BEGIN NOW I shall die! END
BEGIN NOW With slit END
BEGIN NOW ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the END
BEGIN NOW table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the END
BEGIN NOW tailor's shears. END
BEGIN NOW A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. END
BEGIN NOW I don't END
BEGIN NOW want to be debagged! END
BEGIN NOW Don't you play the giddy ox with me! END
BEGIN NOW Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. END
BEGIN NOW A deaf END
BEGIN NOW gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower END
BEGIN NOW on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. END
BEGIN NOW To ourselves... END
BEGIN NOW new paganism... END
BEGIN NOW omphalos. END
BEGIN NOW —Let him stay, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing wrong with him except at END
BEGIN NOW night. END
BEGIN NOW —Then what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. END
BEGIN NOW Cough it up. END
BEGIN NOW I'm END
BEGIN NOW quite frank with you. END
BEGIN NOW What have you against me now? END
BEGIN NOW They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the END
BEGIN NOW water like the snout of a sleeping whale. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen freed his arm quietly. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you wish me to tell you? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember anything. END
BEGIN NOW He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW A light wind passed his brow, END
BEGIN NOW fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of END
BEGIN NOW anxiety in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: END
BEGIN NOW —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's END
BEGIN NOW death? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW I can't remember anything. END
BEGIN NOW I remember only ideas and END
BEGIN NOW sensations. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW What happened in the name of God? END
BEGIN NOW —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get END
BEGIN NOW more hot water. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother and some visitor came out of the END
BEGIN NOW drawingroom. END
BEGIN NOW She asked you who was in your room. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW What did I say? END
BEGIN NOW I forget. END
BEGIN NOW —You said, Stephen answered, O, it's only Dedalus whose mother is END
BEGIN NOW beastly dead. END
BEGIN NOW A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan's cheek. END
BEGIN NOW —Did I say that? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What harm is that? END
BEGIN NOW He shook his constraint from him nervously. END
BEGIN NOW —And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? END
BEGIN NOW You saw END
BEGIN NOW only your mother die. END
BEGIN NOW I see them pop off every day in the Mater and END
BEGIN NOW Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. END
BEGIN NOW It's a beastly END
BEGIN NOW thing and nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW It simply doesn't matter. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't kneel END
BEGIN NOW down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the END
BEGIN NOW wrong way. END
BEGIN NOW To me it's all a mockery and beastly. END
BEGIN NOW Her cerebral lobes are END
BEGIN NOW not functioning. END
BEGIN NOW She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks END
BEGIN NOW buttercups off the quilt. END
BEGIN NOW Humour her till it's over. END
BEGIN NOW You crossed her END
BEGIN NOW last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like END
BEGIN NOW some hired mute from Lalouette's. END
BEGIN NOW Absurd! END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I did say it. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother. END
BEGIN NOW He had spoken himself into boldness. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, shielding the gaping END
BEGIN NOW wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: END
BEGIN NOW —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother. END
BEGIN NOW —Of what then? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. END
BEGIN NOW —O, an impossible person! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW He walked off quickly round the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood at his post, END
BEGIN NOW gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. END
BEGIN NOW Sea and headland now grew END
BEGIN NOW dim. END
BEGIN NOW Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt END
BEGIN NOW the fever of his cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW A voice within the tower called loudly: END
BEGIN NOW —Are you up there, Mulligan? END
BEGIN NOW —I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW He turned towards Stephen and said: END
BEGIN NOW —Look at the sea. END
BEGIN NOW What does it care about offences? END
BEGIN NOW Chuck Loyola, Kinch, END
BEGIN NOW and come on down. END
BEGIN NOW The Sassenach wants his morning rashers. END
BEGIN NOW His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level END
BEGIN NOW with the roof: END
BEGIN NOW —Don't mope over it all day, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm inconsequent. END
BEGIN NOW Give up the END
BEGIN NOW moody brooding. END
BEGIN NOW His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of END
BEGIN NOW the stairhead: END
BEGIN NOW And no more turn aside and brood Upon love's bitter mystery For Fergus END
BEGIN NOW rules the brazen cars. END
BEGIN NOW Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the END
BEGIN NOW stairhead seaward where he gazed. END
BEGIN NOW Inshore and farther out the mirror of END
BEGIN NOW water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. END
BEGIN NOW White breast of the END
BEGIN NOW dim sea. END
BEGIN NOW The twining stresses, two by two. END
BEGIN NOW A hand plucking the END
BEGIN NOW harpstrings, merging their twining chords. END
BEGIN NOW Wavewhite wedded words END
BEGIN NOW shimmering on the dim tide. END
BEGIN NOW A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in END
BEGIN NOW deeper green. END
BEGIN NOW It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. END
BEGIN NOW Fergus' song: END
BEGIN NOW I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. END
BEGIN NOW Her END
BEGIN NOW door was open: she wanted to hear my music. END
BEGIN NOW Silent with awe and pity I END
BEGIN NOW went to her bedside. END
BEGIN NOW She was crying in her wretched bed. END
BEGIN NOW For those END
BEGIN NOW words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery. END
BEGIN NOW Where now? END
BEGIN NOW Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, END
BEGIN NOW a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. END
BEGIN NOW A birdcage hung in the sunny END
BEGIN NOW window of her house when she was a girl. END
BEGIN NOW She heard old Royce sing in the END
BEGIN NOW pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: END
BEGIN NOW I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility. END
BEGIN NOW Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed. END
BEGIN NOW And no more turn aside and brood. END
BEGIN NOW Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. END
BEGIN NOW Memories beset his END
BEGIN NOW brooding brain. END
BEGIN NOW Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had END
BEGIN NOW approached the sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, END
BEGIN NOW roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. END
BEGIN NOW Her shapely END
BEGIN NOW fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's END
BEGIN NOW shirts. END
BEGIN NOW In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its END
BEGIN NOW loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, END
BEGIN NOW bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. END
BEGIN NOW On me END
BEGIN NOW alone. END
BEGIN NOW The ghostcandle to light her agony. END
BEGIN NOW Ghostly light on the tortured END
BEGIN NOW face. END
BEGIN NOW Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on END
BEGIN NOW their knees. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes on me to strike me down. END
BEGIN NOW Liliata rutilantium te END
BEGIN NOW confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat. END
BEGIN NOW Ghoul! END
BEGIN NOW Chewer of corpses! END
BEGIN NOW No, mother! END
BEGIN NOW Let me be and let me live. END
BEGIN NOW —Kinch ahoy! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. END
BEGIN NOW It came nearer up the END
BEGIN NOW staircase, calling again. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry, END
BEGIN NOW heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. END
BEGIN NOW —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. END
BEGIN NOW Breakfast is ready. END
BEGIN NOW Haines is END
BEGIN NOW apologising for waking us last night. END
BEGIN NOW It's all right. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm coming, Stephen said, turning. END
BEGIN NOW —Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW For my sake and for all our END
BEGIN NOW sakes. END
BEGIN NOW His head disappeared and reappeared. END
BEGIN NOW —I told him your symbol of Irish art. END
BEGIN NOW He says it's very clever. END
BEGIN NOW Touch END
BEGIN NOW him for a quid, will you? END
BEGIN NOW A guinea, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW —I get paid this morning, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —The school kip? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW How much? END
BEGIN NOW Four quid? END
BEGIN NOW Lend us one. END
BEGIN NOW —If you want it, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. END
BEGIN NOW We'll have a END
BEGIN NOW glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. END
BEGIN NOW Four omnipotent END
BEGIN NOW sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of END
BEGIN NOW tune with a Cockney accent: END
BEGIN NOW O, won't we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! END
BEGIN NOW On END
BEGIN NOW coronation, Coronation day! END
BEGIN NOW O, won't we have a merry time On coronation END
BEGIN NOW day! END
BEGIN NOW Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. END
BEGIN NOW The nickel shavingbowl shone, END
BEGIN NOW forgotten, on the parapet. END
BEGIN NOW Why should I bring it down? END
BEGIN NOW Or leave it there END
BEGIN NOW all day, forgotten friendship? END
BEGIN NOW He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, END
BEGIN NOW smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. END
BEGIN NOW So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. END
BEGIN NOW I am another now and END
BEGIN NOW yet the same. END
BEGIN NOW A servant too. END
BEGIN NOW A server of a servant. END
BEGIN NOW In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form END
BEGIN NOW moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its END
BEGIN NOW yellow glow. END
BEGIN NOW Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor END
BEGIN NOW from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of END
BEGIN NOW coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. END
BEGIN NOW —We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Haines, open that door, will you? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. END
BEGIN NOW A tall figure rose from the END
BEGIN NOW hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open END
BEGIN NOW the inner doors. END
BEGIN NOW —Have you the key? END
BEGIN NOW a voice asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Janey Mack, I'm choked! END
BEGIN NOW He howled, without looking up from the fire: END
BEGIN NOW —Kinch! END
BEGIN NOW —It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward. END
BEGIN NOW The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been END
BEGIN NOW set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. END
BEGIN NOW Haines stood at the END
BEGIN NOW doorway, looking out. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and END
BEGIN NOW sat down to wait. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set END
BEGIN NOW them down heavily and sighed with relief. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... END
BEGIN NOW But, hush! END
BEGIN NOW Not a END
BEGIN NOW word more on that subject! END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, wake up! END
BEGIN NOW Bread, butter, honey. END
BEGIN NOW Haines, END
BEGIN NOW come in. END
BEGIN NOW The grub is ready. END
BEGIN NOW Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the sugar? END
BEGIN NOW O, jay, there's no milk. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from END
BEGIN NOW the locker. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. END
BEGIN NOW —What sort of a kip is this? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW I told her to come after eight. END
BEGIN NOW —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. END
BEGIN NOW There's a lemon in the END
BEGIN NOW locker. END
BEGIN NOW —O, damn you and your Paris fads! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW I want Sandycove END
BEGIN NOW milk. END
BEGIN NOW Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: END
BEGIN NOW —That woman is coming up with the milk. END
BEGIN NOW —The blessings of God on you! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his END
BEGIN NOW chair. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Pour out the tea there. END
BEGIN NOW The sugar is in the bag. END
BEGIN NOW Here, END
BEGIN NOW I can't go fumbling at the damned eggs. END
BEGIN NOW He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three END
BEGIN NOW plates, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. END
BEGIN NOW Haines sat down to pour out the tea. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. END
BEGIN NOW But, I say, Mulligan, you do END
BEGIN NOW make strong tea, don't you? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's END
BEGIN NOW wheedling voice: END
BEGIN NOW —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. END
BEGIN NOW And when I END
BEGIN NOW makes water I makes water. END
BEGIN NOW —By Jove, it is tea, Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: END
BEGIN NOW —So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Begob, ma'am, says Mrs Cahill, God send END
BEGIN NOW you don't make them in the one pot. END
BEGIN NOW He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled END
BEGIN NOW on his knife. END
BEGIN NOW —That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Five lines END
BEGIN NOW of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of END
BEGIN NOW Dundrum. END
BEGIN NOW Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his END
BEGIN NOW brows: END
BEGIN NOW —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of END
BEGIN NOW in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads? END
BEGIN NOW —I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you now? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. END
BEGIN NOW Your reasons, pray? END
BEGIN NOW —I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the END
BEGIN NOW Mabinogion. END
BEGIN NOW Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight. END
BEGIN NOW —Charming! END
BEGIN NOW he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and END
BEGIN NOW blinking his eyes pleasantly. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think she was? END
BEGIN NOW Quite charming! END
BEGIN NOW Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened END
BEGIN NOW rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: END
BEGIN NOW —For old Mary Ann She doesn't care a damn. END
BEGIN NOW But, hising up her END
BEGIN NOW petticoats... END
BEGIN NOW He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. END
BEGIN NOW The doorway was darkened by an entering form. END
BEGIN NOW —The milk, sir! END
BEGIN NOW —Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Kinch, get the jug. END
BEGIN NOW An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow. END
BEGIN NOW —That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Glory be to God. END
BEGIN NOW —To whom? END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan said, glancing at her. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, to be sure! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. END
BEGIN NOW —The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of END
BEGIN NOW the collector of prepuces. END
BEGIN NOW —How much, sir? END
BEGIN NOW asked the old woman. END
BEGIN NOW —A quart, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white END
BEGIN NOW milk, not hers. END
BEGIN NOW Old shrunken paps. END
BEGIN NOW She poured again a measureful and a END
BEGIN NOW tilly. END
BEGIN NOW Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a END
BEGIN NOW messenger. END
BEGIN NOW She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. END
BEGIN NOW Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her END
BEGIN NOW toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. END
BEGIN NOW They lowed END
BEGIN NOW about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. END
BEGIN NOW Silk of the kine and poor old END
BEGIN NOW woman, names given her in old times. END
BEGIN NOW A wandering crone, lowly form of an END
BEGIN NOW immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common END
BEGIN NOW cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. END
BEGIN NOW To serve or to upbraid, END
BEGIN NOW whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. END
BEGIN NOW —It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. END
BEGIN NOW —Taste it, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He drank at her bidding. END
BEGIN NOW —If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat END
BEGIN NOW loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten END
BEGIN NOW guts. END
BEGIN NOW Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with END
BEGIN NOW dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you a medical student, sir? END
BEGIN NOW the old woman asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered. END
BEGIN NOW —Look at that now, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen listened in scornful silence. END
BEGIN NOW She bows her old head to a voice END
BEGIN NOW that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she END
BEGIN NOW slights. END
BEGIN NOW To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there END
BEGIN NOW is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in END
BEGIN NOW God's likeness, the serpent's prey. END
BEGIN NOW And to the loud voice that now bids END
BEGIN NOW her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you understand what he says? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked her. END
BEGIN NOW —Is it French you are talking, sir? END
BEGIN NOW the old woman said to Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. END
BEGIN NOW —Irish, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Is there Gaelic on you? END
BEGIN NOW —I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. END
BEGIN NOW Are you from the END
BEGIN NOW west, sir? END
BEGIN NOW —I am an Englishman, Haines answered. END
BEGIN NOW —He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish END
BEGIN NOW in Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW —Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the END
BEGIN NOW language myself. END
BEGIN NOW I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows. END
BEGIN NOW —Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful entirely. END
BEGIN NOW Fill END
BEGIN NOW us out some more tea, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a cup, ma'am? END
BEGIN NOW —No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the END
BEGIN NOW milkcan on her forearm and about to go. END
BEGIN NOW Haines said to her: END
BEGIN NOW —Have you your bill? END
BEGIN NOW We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen filled again the three cups. END
BEGIN NOW —Bill, sir? END
BEGIN NOW she said, halting. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's seven mornings a pint at END
BEGIN NOW twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three END
BEGIN NOW mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. END
BEGIN NOW That's a END
BEGIN NOW shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly END
BEGIN NOW buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his END
BEGIN NOW trouser pockets. END
BEGIN NOW —Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the END
BEGIN NOW thick rich milk. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in END
BEGIN NOW his fingers and cried: END
BEGIN NOW —A miracle! END
BEGIN NOW He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —Ask nothing more of me, sweet. END
BEGIN NOW All I can give you I give. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. END
BEGIN NOW —We'll owe twopence, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW Good morning, END
BEGIN NOW sir. END
BEGIN NOW She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant: END
BEGIN NOW —Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your feet. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and said: END
BEGIN NOW —Seriously, Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW I'm stony. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry out to your school kip and bring END
BEGIN NOW us back some money. END
BEGIN NOW Today the bards must drink and junket. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland END
BEGIN NOW expects that every man this day will do his duty. END
BEGIN NOW —That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your END
BEGIN NOW national library today. END
BEGIN NOW —Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: END
BEGIN NOW —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch? END
BEGIN NOW Then he said to Haines: END
BEGIN NOW —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. END
BEGIN NOW —All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey END
BEGIN NOW trickle over a slice of the loaf. END
BEGIN NOW Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the END
BEGIN NOW loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: END
BEGIN NOW —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking to me. END
BEGIN NOW They wash and tub and scrub. END
BEGIN NOW Agenbite of inwit. END
BEGIN NOW Conscience. END
BEGIN NOW Yet here's a spot. END
BEGIN NOW —That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol END
BEGIN NOW of Irish art is deuced good. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth END
BEGIN NOW of tone: END
BEGIN NOW —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW I was just END
BEGIN NOW thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. END
BEGIN NOW —Would I make any money by it? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of END
BEGIN NOW the hammock, said: END
BEGIN NOW —I don't know, I'm sure. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out to the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and END
BEGIN NOW said with coarse vigour: END
BEGIN NOW —You put your hoof in it now. END
BEGIN NOW What did you say that for? END
BEGIN NOW —Well? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The problem is to get money. END
BEGIN NOW From whom? END
BEGIN NOW From the END
BEGIN NOW milkwoman or from him. END
BEGIN NOW It's a toss up, I think. END
BEGIN NOW —I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along END
BEGIN NOW with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. END
BEGIN NOW —I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm. END
BEGIN NOW —From me, Kinch, he said. END
BEGIN NOW In a suddenly changed tone he added: END
BEGIN NOW —To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. END
BEGIN NOW Damn all else they END
BEGIN NOW are good for. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you play them as I do? END
BEGIN NOW To hell with them all. END
BEGIN NOW Let us get out of the kip. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying END
BEGIN NOW resignedly: END
BEGIN NOW —Mulligan is stripped of his garments. END
BEGIN NOW He emptied his pockets on to the table. END
BEGIN NOW —There's your snotrag, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, END
BEGIN NOW chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. END
BEGIN NOW His hands plunged and END
BEGIN NOW rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW God, END
BEGIN NOW we'll simply have to dress the character. END
BEGIN NOW I want puce gloves and green END
BEGIN NOW boots. END
BEGIN NOW Contradiction. END
BEGIN NOW Do I contradict myself? END
BEGIN NOW Very well then, I END
BEGIN NOW contradict myself. END
BEGIN NOW Mercurial Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW A limp black missile flew out of END
BEGIN NOW his talking hands. END
BEGIN NOW —And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen picked it up and put it on. END
BEGIN NOW Haines called to them from the END
BEGIN NOW doorway: END
BEGIN NOW —Are you coming, you fellows? END
BEGIN NOW —I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. END
BEGIN NOW Come out, END
BEGIN NOW Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You have eaten all we left, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Resigned he passed out END
BEGIN NOW with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: END
BEGIN NOW —And going forth he met Butterly. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out END
BEGIN NOW and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and END
BEGIN NOW locked it. END
BEGIN NOW He put the huge key in his inner pocket. END
BEGIN NOW At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: END
BEGIN NOW —Did you bring the key? END
BEGIN NOW —I have it, Stephen said, preceding them. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy END
BEGIN NOW bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. END
BEGIN NOW —Down, sir! END
BEGIN NOW How dare you, sir! END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked: END
BEGIN NOW —Do you pay rent for this tower? END
BEGIN NOW —Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW —To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: END
BEGIN NOW —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. END
BEGIN NOW Martello you call it? END
BEGIN NOW —Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on END
BEGIN NOW the sea. END
BEGIN NOW But ours is the omphalos. END
BEGIN NOW —What is your idea of Hamlet? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW —No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas END
BEGIN NOW and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I END
BEGIN NOW have a few pints in me first. END
BEGIN NOW He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his END
BEGIN NOW primrose waistcoat: END
BEGIN NOW —You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you? END
BEGIN NOW —It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. END
BEGIN NOW —You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. END
BEGIN NOW Is it some paradox? END
BEGIN NOW —Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. END
BEGIN NOW It's quite simple. END
BEGIN NOW He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own END
BEGIN NOW father. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW He himself? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in END
BEGIN NOW loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear: END
BEGIN NOW —O, shade of Kinch the elder! END
BEGIN NOW Japhet in search of a father! END
BEGIN NOW —We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. END
BEGIN NOW And it is END
BEGIN NOW rather long to tell. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. END
BEGIN NOW —The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower END
BEGIN NOW and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. END
BEGIN NOW That beetles o'er END
BEGIN NOW his base into the sea, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not END
BEGIN NOW speak. END
BEGIN NOW In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap END
BEGIN NOW dusty mourning between their gay attires. END
BEGIN NOW —It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. END
BEGIN NOW The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the END
BEGIN NOW smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail END
BEGIN NOW tacking by the Muglins. END
BEGIN NOW —I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. END
BEGIN NOW The Father and the Son idea. END
BEGIN NOW The Son striving to be atoned with the END
BEGIN NOW Father. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at END
BEGIN NOW them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had END
BEGIN NOW suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW He moved END
BEGIN NOW a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and END
BEGIN NOW began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: END
BEGIN NOW —I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard. END
BEGIN NOW My mother's a jew, END
BEGIN NOW my father's a bird. END
BEGIN NOW With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree. END
BEGIN NOW So here's to END
BEGIN NOW disciples and Calvary. END
BEGIN NOW He held up a forefinger of warning. END
BEGIN NOW —If anyone thinks that I amn't divine He'll get no free drinks when I'm END
BEGIN NOW making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I END
BEGIN NOW make when the wine becomes water again. END
BEGIN NOW He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward END
BEGIN NOW to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or END
BEGIN NOW wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: END
BEGIN NOW —Goodbye, now, goodbye! END
BEGIN NOW Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and END
BEGIN NOW Harry I rose from the dead. END
BEGIN NOW What's bred in the bone cannot fail me to END
BEGIN NOW fly And Olivet's breezy... END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye, now, goodbye! END
BEGIN NOW He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his END
BEGIN NOW winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh END
BEGIN NOW wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. END
BEGIN NOW Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and END
BEGIN NOW said: END
BEGIN NOW —We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW He's rather blasphemous. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a END
BEGIN NOW believer myself, that is to say. END
BEGIN NOW Still his gaiety takes the harm out of END
BEGIN NOW it somehow, doesn't it? END
BEGIN NOW What did he call it? END
BEGIN NOW Joseph the Joiner? END
BEGIN NOW —The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW —O, Haines said, you have heard it before? END
BEGIN NOW —Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily. END
BEGIN NOW —You're not a believer, are you? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, a believer in the END
BEGIN NOW narrow sense of the word. END
BEGIN NOW Creation from nothing and miracles and a END
BEGIN NOW personal God. END
BEGIN NOW —There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a END
BEGIN NOW green stone. END
BEGIN NOW He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. END
BEGIN NOW He put it back in his END
BEGIN NOW sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang END
BEGIN NOW it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk END
BEGIN NOW towards Stephen in the shell of his hands. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. END
BEGIN NOW Either you believe or END
BEGIN NOW you don't, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a END
BEGIN NOW personal God. END
BEGIN NOW You don't stand for that, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW —You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible END
BEGIN NOW example of free thought. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his END
BEGIN NOW side. END
BEGIN NOW Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. END
BEGIN NOW My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! END
BEGIN NOW A wavering line END
BEGIN NOW along the path. END
BEGIN NOW They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW He wants that key. END
BEGIN NOW It is mine. END
BEGIN NOW I paid the rent. END
BEGIN NOW Now I eat his salt END
BEGIN NOW bread. END
BEGIN NOW Give him the key too. END
BEGIN NOW All. END
BEGIN NOW He will ask for it. END
BEGIN NOW That was in his END
BEGIN NOW eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —After all, Haines began... END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not END
BEGIN NOW all unkind. END
BEGIN NOW —After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. END
BEGIN NOW You are your END
BEGIN NOW own master, it seems to me. END
BEGIN NOW —I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian. END
BEGIN NOW —Italian? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW A crazy queen, old and jealous. END
BEGIN NOW Kneel down before me. END
BEGIN NOW —And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. END
BEGIN NOW —Italian? END
BEGIN NOW Haines said again. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW —The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and END
BEGIN NOW the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. END
BEGIN NOW Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he END
BEGIN NOW spoke. END
BEGIN NOW —I can quite understand that, he said calmly. END
BEGIN NOW An Irishman must think END
BEGIN NOW like that, I daresay. END
BEGIN NOW We feel in England that we have treated you rather END
BEGIN NOW unfairly. END
BEGIN NOW It seems history is to blame. END
BEGIN NOW The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of END
BEGIN NOW their brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: END
BEGIN NOW the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, END
BEGIN NOW a chemistry of stars. END
BEGIN NOW Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope END
BEGIN NOW Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and END
BEGIN NOW behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed END
BEGIN NOW and menaced her heresiarchs. END
BEGIN NOW A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres END
BEGIN NOW awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and END
BEGIN NOW Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with END
BEGIN NOW the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ's terrene body, and the END
BEGIN NOW subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself END
BEGIN NOW His own Son. END
BEGIN NOW Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the END
BEGIN NOW stranger. END
BEGIN NOW Idle mockery. END
BEGIN NOW The void awaits surely all them that weave the END
BEGIN NOW wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels END
BEGIN NOW of the church, Michael's host, who defend her ever in the hour of END
BEGIN NOW conflict with their lances and their shields. END
BEGIN NOW Hear, hear! END
BEGIN NOW Prolonged applause. END
BEGIN NOW Zut! END
BEGIN NOW Nom de Dieu! END
BEGIN NOW —Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. END
BEGIN NOW That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now. END
BEGIN NOW Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. END
BEGIN NOW —She's making for Bullock harbour. END
BEGIN NOW The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. END
BEGIN NOW —There's five fathoms out there, he said. END
BEGIN NOW It'll be swept up that way END
BEGIN NOW when the tide comes in about one. END
BEGIN NOW It's nine days today. END
BEGIN NOW The man that was drowned. END
BEGIN NOW A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for END
BEGIN NOW a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, END
BEGIN NOW saltwhite. END
BEGIN NOW Here I am. END
BEGIN NOW They followed the winding path down to the creek. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan stood on END
BEGIN NOW a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise END
BEGIN NOW his green legs in the deep jelly of the water. END
BEGIN NOW —Is the brother with you, Malachi? END
BEGIN NOW —Down in Westmeath. END
BEGIN NOW With the Bannons. END
BEGIN NOW —Still there? END
BEGIN NOW I got a card from Bannon. END
BEGIN NOW Says he found a sweet young END
BEGIN NOW thing down there. END
BEGIN NOW Photo girl he calls her. END
BEGIN NOW —Snapshot, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Brief exposure. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. END
BEGIN NOW An elderly man shot up near END
BEGIN NOW the spur of rock a blowing red face. END
BEGIN NOW He scrambled up by the stones, END
BEGIN NOW water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water END
BEGIN NOW rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black END
BEGIN NOW sagging loincloth. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines END
BEGIN NOW and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips END
BEGIN NOW and breastbone. END
BEGIN NOW —Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of END
BEGIN NOW rock. END
BEGIN NOW Chucked medicine and going in for the army. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, go to God! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW —Going over next week to stew. END
BEGIN NOW You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW —Spooning with him last night on the pier. END
BEGIN NOW The father is rotto with END
BEGIN NOW money. END
BEGIN NOW —Is she up the pole? END
BEGIN NOW —Better ask Seymour that. END
BEGIN NOW —Seymour a bleeding officer! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying END
BEGIN NOW tritely: END
BEGIN NOW —Redheaded women buck like goats. END
BEGIN NOW He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt. END
BEGIN NOW —My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the Ãœbermensch. END
BEGIN NOW Toothless Kinch END
BEGIN NOW and I, the supermen. END
BEGIN NOW He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his END
BEGIN NOW clothes lay. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you going in here, Malachi? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Make room in the bed. END
BEGIN NOW The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the END
BEGIN NOW middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. END
BEGIN NOW Haines sat down on a END
BEGIN NOW stone, smoking. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you not coming in? END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Later on, Haines said. END
BEGIN NOW Not on my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned away. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm going, Mulligan, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen handed him the key. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped END
BEGIN NOW clothes. END
BEGIN NOW —And twopence, he said, for a pint. END
BEGIN NOW Throw it there. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. END
BEGIN NOW Dressing, undressing. END
BEGIN NOW Buck END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: END
BEGIN NOW —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Thus spake END
BEGIN NOW Zarathustra. END
BEGIN NOW His plump body plunged. END
BEGIN NOW —We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path END
BEGIN NOW and smiling at wild Irish. END
BEGIN NOW Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon. END
BEGIN NOW —The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW Half twelve. END
BEGIN NOW —Good, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He walked along the upwardcurving path. END
BEGIN NOW Liliata rutilantium. END
BEGIN NOW Turma circumdet. END
BEGIN NOW Iubilantium te virginum. END
BEGIN NOW The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. END
BEGIN NOW I will END
BEGIN NOW not sleep here tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Home also I cannot go. END
BEGIN NOW A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Turning END
BEGIN NOW the curve he waved his hand. END
BEGIN NOW It called again. END
BEGIN NOW A sleek brown head, a END
BEGIN NOW seal's, far out on the water, round. END
BEGIN NOW Usurper. END
BEGIN NOW [ 2 ] END
BEGIN NOW —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him? END
BEGIN NOW —Tarentum, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW —There was a battle, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW The boy's blank face asked the blank window. END
BEGIN NOW Fabled by the daughters of memory. END
BEGIN NOW And yet it was in some way if not as END
BEGIN NOW memory fabled it. END
BEGIN NOW A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings END
BEGIN NOW of excess. END
BEGIN NOW I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling END
BEGIN NOW masonry, and time one livid final flame. END
BEGIN NOW What's left us then? END
BEGIN NOW —I forget the place, sir. END
BEGIN NOW 279 B. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred END
BEGIN NOW book. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for. END
BEGIN NOW That phrase the world had remembered. END
BEGIN NOW A dull ease of the mind. END
BEGIN NOW From a END
BEGIN NOW hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, END
BEGIN NOW leaned upon his spear. END
BEGIN NOW Any general to any officers. END
BEGIN NOW They lend ear. END
BEGIN NOW —You, Armstrong, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW What was the end of Pyrrhus? END
BEGIN NOW —End of Pyrrhus, sir? END
BEGIN NOW —I know, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Ask me, sir, Comyn said. END
BEGIN NOW —Wait. END
BEGIN NOW You, Armstrong. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know anything about Pyrrhus? END
BEGIN NOW A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. END
BEGIN NOW He curled them END
BEGIN NOW between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. END
BEGIN NOW Crumbs adhered to END
BEGIN NOW the tissue of his lips. END
BEGIN NOW A sweetened boy's breath. END
BEGIN NOW Welloff people, proud END
BEGIN NOW that their eldest son was in the navy. END
BEGIN NOW Vico road, Dalkey. END
BEGIN NOW —Pyrrhus, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Pyrrhus, a pier. END
BEGIN NOW All laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Mirthless high malicious laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Armstrong looked round END
BEGIN NOW at his classmates, silly glee in profile. END
BEGIN NOW In a moment they will laugh END
BEGIN NOW more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book, END
BEGIN NOW what is a pier. END
BEGIN NOW —A pier, sir, Armstrong said. END
BEGIN NOW A thing out in the water. END
BEGIN NOW A kind of a END
BEGIN NOW bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Kingstown pier, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. END
BEGIN NOW Two in the back bench END
BEGIN NOW whispered. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. END
BEGIN NOW All. END
BEGIN NOW With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. END
BEGIN NOW Their END
BEGIN NOW likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets END
BEGIN NOW tittering in the struggle. END
BEGIN NOW —Kingstown pier, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a disappointed bridge. END
BEGIN NOW The words troubled their gaze. END
BEGIN NOW —How, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Comyn asked. END
BEGIN NOW A bridge is across a river. END
BEGIN NOW For Haines's chapbook. END
BEGIN NOW No-one here to hear. END
BEGIN NOW Tonight deftly amid wild END
BEGIN NOW drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. END
BEGIN NOW What then? END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a END
BEGIN NOW clement master's praise. END
BEGIN NOW Why had they chosen all that part? END
BEGIN NOW Not wholly END
BEGIN NOW for the smooth caress. END
BEGIN NOW For them too history was a tale like any other END
BEGIN NOW too often heard, their land a pawnshop. END
BEGIN NOW Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not END
BEGIN NOW been knifed to death. END
BEGIN NOW They are not to be thought away. END
BEGIN NOW Time has branded END
BEGIN NOW them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite END
BEGIN NOW possibilities they have ousted. END
BEGIN NOW But can those have been possible seeing END
BEGIN NOW that they never were? END
BEGIN NOW Or was that only possible which came to pass? END
BEGIN NOW Weave, weaver of the wind. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell us a story, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —O, do, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A ghoststory. END
BEGIN NOW —Where do you begin in this? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked, opening another book. END
BEGIN NOW —Weep no more, Comyn said. END
BEGIN NOW —Go on then, Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW —And the story, sir? END
BEGIN NOW —After, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Go on, Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork END
BEGIN NOW of his satchel. END
BEGIN NOW He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: END
BEGIN NOW —Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... END
BEGIN NOW It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated END
BEGIN NOW out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he END
BEGIN NOW had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. END
BEGIN NOW By his elbow END
BEGIN NOW a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. END
BEGIN NOW Fed and feeding brains END
BEGIN NOW about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in END
BEGIN NOW my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of END
BEGIN NOW brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. END
BEGIN NOW Thought is the thought of END
BEGIN NOW thought. END
BEGIN NOW Tranquil brightness. END
BEGIN NOW The soul is in a manner all that is: the END
BEGIN NOW soul is the form of forms. END
BEGIN NOW Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of END
BEGIN NOW forms. END
BEGIN NOW Talbot repeated: END
BEGIN NOW —Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear END
BEGIN NOW might... END
BEGIN NOW —Turn over, Stephen said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW I don't see anything. END
BEGIN NOW —What, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Talbot asked simply, bending forward. END
BEGIN NOW His hand turned the page over. END
BEGIN NOW He leaned back and went on again, having END
BEGIN NOW just remembered. END
BEGIN NOW Of him that walked the waves. END
BEGIN NOW Here also over these END
BEGIN NOW craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and on END
BEGIN NOW mine. END
BEGIN NOW It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the END
BEGIN NOW tribute. END
BEGIN NOW To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. END
BEGIN NOW A long look END
BEGIN NOW from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the END
BEGIN NOW church's looms. END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. END
BEGIN NOW My father gave me seeds to sow. END
BEGIN NOW Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel. END
BEGIN NOW —Have I heard all? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Hockey at ten, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Half day, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Thursday. END
BEGIN NOW —Who can answer a riddle? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. END
BEGIN NOW Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling END
BEGIN NOW gaily: END
BEGIN NOW —A riddle, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Ask me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —O, ask me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —A hard one, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —This is the riddle, Stephen said: END
BEGIN NOW The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking END
BEGIN NOW eleven. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven. END
BEGIN NOW What is that? END
BEGIN NOW —What, sir? END
BEGIN NOW —Again, sir. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. END
BEGIN NOW After a silence END
BEGIN NOW Cochrane said: END
BEGIN NOW —What is it, sir? END
BEGIN NOW We give it up. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, his throat itching, answered: END
BEGIN NOW —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries END
BEGIN NOW echoed dismay. END
BEGIN NOW A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: END
BEGIN NOW —Hockey! END
BEGIN NOW They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. END
BEGIN NOW Quickly END
BEGIN NOW they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and END
BEGIN NOW clamour of their boots and tongues. END
BEGIN NOW Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open END
BEGIN NOW copybook. END
BEGIN NOW His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness END
BEGIN NOW and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. END
BEGIN NOW On his END
BEGIN NOW cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent END
BEGIN NOW and damp as a snail's bed. END
BEGIN NOW He held out his copybook. END
BEGIN NOW The word Sums was written on the headline. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with END
BEGIN NOW blind loops and a blot. END
BEGIN NOW Cyril Sargent: his name and seal. END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to END
BEGIN NOW you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen touched the edges of the book. END
BEGIN NOW Futility. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you understand how to do them now? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy said I was to END
BEGIN NOW copy them off the board, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Can you do them yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW —No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a END
BEGIN NOW snail's bed. END
BEGIN NOW Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her END
BEGIN NOW heart. END
BEGIN NOW But for her the race of the world would have trampled him END
BEGIN NOW underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. END
BEGIN NOW She had loved his weak watery END
BEGIN NOW blood drained from her own. END
BEGIN NOW Was that then real? END
BEGIN NOW The only true thing in END
BEGIN NOW life? END
BEGIN NOW His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal END
BEGIN NOW bestrode. END
BEGIN NOW She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the END
BEGIN NOW fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. END
BEGIN NOW She had saved him from END
BEGIN NOW being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. END
BEGIN NOW A poor soul END
BEGIN NOW gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of END
BEGIN NOW rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, END
BEGIN NOW listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped. END
BEGIN NOW Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. END
BEGIN NOW He proves by algebra END
BEGIN NOW that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. END
BEGIN NOW Sargent peered askance END
BEGIN NOW through his slanted glasses. END
BEGIN NOW Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the END
BEGIN NOW hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field. END
BEGIN NOW Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of END
BEGIN NOW their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. END
BEGIN NOW Give hands, END
BEGIN NOW traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. END
BEGIN NOW Gone too from END
BEGIN NOW the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, END
BEGIN NOW flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a END
BEGIN NOW darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you understand now? END
BEGIN NOW Can you work the second for yourself? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. END
BEGIN NOW Waiting always for a word END
BEGIN NOW of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of END
BEGIN NOW shame flickering behind his dull skin. END
BEGIN NOW Amor matris: subjective and END
BEGIN NOW objective genitive. END
BEGIN NOW With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed END
BEGIN NOW him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands. END
BEGIN NOW Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. END
BEGIN NOW My END
BEGIN NOW childhood bends beside me. END
BEGIN NOW Too far for me to lay a hand there once or END
BEGIN NOW lightly. END
BEGIN NOW Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Secrets, silent, stony END
BEGIN NOW sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their END
BEGIN NOW tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned. END
BEGIN NOW The sum was done. END
BEGIN NOW —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, Sargent answered. END
BEGIN NOW He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his END
BEGIN NOW copybook back to his bench. END
BEGIN NOW —You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as END
BEGIN NOW he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield. END
BEGIN NOW —Sargent! END
BEGIN NOW —Run on, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy is calling you. END
BEGIN NOW He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy END
BEGIN NOW field where sharp voices were in strife. END
BEGIN NOW They were sorted in teams and END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. END
BEGIN NOW When END
BEGIN NOW he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW turned his angry white moustache. END
BEGIN NOW —What is it now? END
BEGIN NOW he cried continually without listening. END
BEGIN NOW —Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore END
BEGIN NOW order here. END
BEGIN NOW And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice END
BEGIN NOW cried sternly: END
BEGIN NOW —What is the matter? END
BEGIN NOW What is it now? END
BEGIN NOW Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed END
BEGIN NOW round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head. END
BEGIN NOW Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather END
BEGIN NOW of its chairs. END
BEGIN NOW As on the first day he bargained with me here. END
BEGIN NOW As it was END
BEGIN NOW in the beginning, is now. END
BEGIN NOW On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, END
BEGIN NOW base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. END
BEGIN NOW And snug in their spooncase END
BEGIN NOW of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the END
BEGIN NOW gentiles: world without end. END
BEGIN NOW A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. END
BEGIN NOW Blowing out his END
BEGIN NOW rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table. END
BEGIN NOW —First, our little financial settlement, he said. END
BEGIN NOW He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and END
BEGIN NOW laid them carefully on the table. END
BEGIN NOW —Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. END
BEGIN NOW And now his strongroom for the gold. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's embarrassed hand moved END
BEGIN NOW over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money END
BEGIN NOW cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and END
BEGIN NOW this, the scallop of saint James. END
BEGIN NOW An old pilgrim's hoard, dead treasure, END
BEGIN NOW hollow shells. END
BEGIN NOW A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth. END
BEGIN NOW —Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW These are handy things to have. END
BEGIN NOW See. END
BEGIN NOW This is for sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW This is for END
BEGIN NOW shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Sixpences, halfcrowns. END
BEGIN NOW And here crowns. END
BEGIN NOW See. END
BEGIN NOW He shot from it two crowns and two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW —Three twelve, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I think you'll find that's right. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy END
BEGIN NOW haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. END
BEGIN NOW —No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You have earned it. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. END
BEGIN NOW Symbols too END
BEGIN NOW of beauty and of power. END
BEGIN NOW A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and END
BEGIN NOW misery. END
BEGIN NOW —Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You'll pull it out somewhere END
BEGIN NOW and lose it. END
BEGIN NOW You just buy one of these machines. END
BEGIN NOW You'll find them very END
BEGIN NOW handy. END
BEGIN NOW Answer something. END
BEGIN NOW —Mine would be often empty, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. END
BEGIN NOW Three times END
BEGIN NOW now. END
BEGIN NOW Three nooses round me here. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW I can break them in this instant END
BEGIN NOW if I will. END
BEGIN NOW —Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. END
BEGIN NOW You don't END
BEGIN NOW know yet what money is. END
BEGIN NOW Money is power. END
BEGIN NOW When you have lived as long as I END
BEGIN NOW have. END
BEGIN NOW I know, I know. END
BEGIN NOW If youth but knew. END
BEGIN NOW But what does Shakespeare say? END
BEGIN NOW Put but money in thy purse. END
BEGIN NOW —Iago, Stephen murmured. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare. END
BEGIN NOW —He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW He made money. END
BEGIN NOW A poet, yes, but END
BEGIN NOW an Englishman too. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what is the pride of the English? END
BEGIN NOW Do you END
BEGIN NOW know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's END
BEGIN NOW mouth? END
BEGIN NOW The seas' ruler. END
BEGIN NOW His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems END
BEGIN NOW history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating. END
BEGIN NOW —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets. END
BEGIN NOW —Ba! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy cried. END
BEGIN NOW That's not English. END
BEGIN NOW A French Celt said that. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. END
BEGIN NOW —I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. END
BEGIN NOW I paid END
BEGIN NOW my way. END
BEGIN NOW Good man, good man. END
BEGIN NOW —I paid my way. END
BEGIN NOW I never borrowed a shilling in my life. END
BEGIN NOW Can you feel END
BEGIN NOW that? END
BEGIN NOW I owe nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Can you? END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. END
BEGIN NOW Curran, ten guineas. END
BEGIN NOW McCann, one guinea. END
BEGIN NOW Fred Ryan, two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Temple, two lunches. END
BEGIN NOW Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob END
BEGIN NOW Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five END
BEGIN NOW weeks' board. END
BEGIN NOW The lump I have is useless. END
BEGIN NOW —For the moment, no, Stephen answered. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox. END
BEGIN NOW —I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. END
BEGIN NOW But one day you must feel it. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW are a generous people but we must also be just. END
BEGIN NOW —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the END
BEGIN NOW shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of END
BEGIN NOW Wales. END
BEGIN NOW —You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW saw three generations since O'Connell's time. END
BEGIN NOW I remember the famine in END
BEGIN NOW '46. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union END
BEGIN NOW twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your END
BEGIN NOW communion denounced him as a demagogue? END
BEGIN NOW You fenians forget some things. END
BEGIN NOW Glorious, pious and immortal memory. END
BEGIN NOW The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the END
BEGIN NOW splendid behung with corpses of papishes. END
BEGIN NOW Hoarse, masked and armed, the END
BEGIN NOW planters' covenant. END
BEGIN NOW The black north and true blue bible. END
BEGIN NOW Croppies lie END
BEGIN NOW down. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen sketched a brief gesture. END
BEGIN NOW —I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW On the spindle side. END
BEGIN NOW But I END
BEGIN NOW am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. END
BEGIN NOW We are all END
BEGIN NOW Irish, all kings' sons. END
BEGIN NOW —Alas, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —Per vias rectas, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. END
BEGIN NOW He voted for it END
BEGIN NOW and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do END
BEGIN NOW so. END
BEGIN NOW Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. END
BEGIN NOW Soft day, sir John! END
BEGIN NOW Soft day, your honour!... END
BEGIN NOW Day!... END
BEGIN NOW Day!... END
BEGIN NOW Two topboots jog dangling on END
BEGIN NOW to Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Lal the ral the ra. END
BEGIN NOW Lal the ral the raddy. END
BEGIN NOW —That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, END
BEGIN NOW with some of your literary friends. END
BEGIN NOW I have a letter here for the press. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down a moment. END
BEGIN NOW I have just to copy the end. END
BEGIN NOW He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read END
BEGIN NOW off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. END
BEGIN NOW —Sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common END
BEGIN NOW sense. END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow END
BEGIN NOW and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, END
BEGIN NOW sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. END
BEGIN NOW Framed END
BEGIN NOW around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek END
BEGIN NOW heads poised in air: lord Hastings' Repulse, the duke of Westminster's END
BEGIN NOW Shotover, the duke of Beaufort's Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. END
BEGIN NOW Elfin END
BEGIN NOW riders sat them, watchful of a sign. END
BEGIN NOW He saw their speeds, backing king's END
BEGIN NOW colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds. END
BEGIN NOW —Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. END
BEGIN NOW But prompt ventilation of this END
BEGIN NOW allimportant question... END
BEGIN NOW Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the END
BEGIN NOW mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek END
BEGIN NOW of the canteen, over the motley slush. END
BEGIN NOW Even money Fair Rebel. END
BEGIN NOW Ten to one END
BEGIN NOW the field. END
BEGIN NOW Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the END
BEGIN NOW vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, END
BEGIN NOW nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange. END
BEGIN NOW Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle. END
BEGIN NOW Again: a goal. END
BEGIN NOW I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, END
BEGIN NOW the joust of life. END
BEGIN NOW You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems END
BEGIN NOW to be slightly crawsick? END
BEGIN NOW Jousts. END
BEGIN NOW Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. END
BEGIN NOW Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, END
BEGIN NOW a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts. END
BEGIN NOW —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising. END
BEGIN NOW He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen stood up. END
BEGIN NOW —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW It's about the END
BEGIN NOW foot and mouth disease. END
BEGIN NOW Just look through it. END
BEGIN NOW There can be no two END
BEGIN NOW opinions on the matter. END
BEGIN NOW May I trespass on your valuable space. END
BEGIN NOW That doctrine of laissez faire END
BEGIN NOW which so often in our history. END
BEGIN NOW Our cattle trade. END
BEGIN NOW The way of all our old END
BEGIN NOW industries. END
BEGIN NOW Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. END
BEGIN NOW European conflagration. END
BEGIN NOW Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the END
BEGIN NOW channel. END
BEGIN NOW The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of END
BEGIN NOW agriculture. END
BEGIN NOW Pardoned a classical allusion. END
BEGIN NOW Cassandra. END
BEGIN NOW By a woman who END
BEGIN NOW was no better than she should be. END
BEGIN NOW To come to the point at issue. END
BEGIN NOW —I don't mince words, do I? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on. END
BEGIN NOW Foot and mouth disease. END
BEGIN NOW Known as Koch's preparation. END
BEGIN NOW Serum and virus. END
BEGIN NOW Percentage of salted horses. END
BEGIN NOW Rinderpest. END
BEGIN NOW Emperor's horses at MÃ¼rzsteg, END
BEGIN NOW lower Austria. END
BEGIN NOW Veterinary surgeons. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Henry Blackwood Price. END
BEGIN NOW Courteous END
BEGIN NOW offer a fair trial. END
BEGIN NOW Dictates of common sense. END
BEGIN NOW Allimportant question. END
BEGIN NOW In END
BEGIN NOW every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. END
BEGIN NOW Thanking you for the END
BEGIN NOW hospitality of your columns. END
BEGIN NOW —I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You will see at the END
BEGIN NOW next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. END
BEGIN NOW And it can be END
BEGIN NOW cured. END
BEGIN NOW It is cured. END
BEGIN NOW My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is END
BEGIN NOW regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW offer to come over here. END
BEGIN NOW I am trying to work up influence with the END
BEGIN NOW department. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm going to try publicity. END
BEGIN NOW I am surrounded by END
BEGIN NOW difficulties, by... END
BEGIN NOW intrigues by... END
BEGIN NOW backstairs influence by... END
BEGIN NOW He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke. END
BEGIN NOW —Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW England is in the hands of the END
BEGIN NOW jews. END
BEGIN NOW In all the highest places: her finance, her press. END
BEGIN NOW And they are END
BEGIN NOW the signs of a nation's decay. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever they gather they eat up the END
BEGIN NOW nation's vital strength. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen it coming these years. END
BEGIN NOW As sure as END
BEGIN NOW we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of END
BEGIN NOW destruction. END
BEGIN NOW Old England is dying. END
BEGIN NOW He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a END
BEGIN NOW broad sunbeam. END
BEGIN NOW He faced about and back again. END
BEGIN NOW —Dying, he said again, if not dead by now. END
BEGIN NOW The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old England's END
BEGIN NOW windingsheet. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which END
BEGIN NOW he halted. END
BEGIN NOW —A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or END
BEGIN NOW gentile, is he not? END
BEGIN NOW —They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. END
BEGIN NOW And you can see END
BEGIN NOW the darkness in their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW And that is why they are wanderers on the END
BEGIN NOW earth to this day. END
BEGIN NOW On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting END
BEGIN NOW prices on their gemmed fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Gabble of geese. END
BEGIN NOW They swarmed loud, END
BEGIN NOW uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk END
BEGIN NOW hats. END
BEGIN NOW Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. END
BEGIN NOW Their full END
BEGIN NOW slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew END
BEGIN NOW the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. END
BEGIN NOW Vain END
BEGIN NOW patience to heap and hoard. END
BEGIN NOW Time surely would scatter all. END
BEGIN NOW A hoard END
BEGIN NOW heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes knew their END
BEGIN NOW years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh. END
BEGIN NOW —Who has not? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked. END
BEGIN NOW He came forward a pace and stood by the table. END
BEGIN NOW His underjaw fell END
BEGIN NOW sideways open uncertainly. END
BEGIN NOW Is this old wisdom? END
BEGIN NOW He waits to hear from me. END
BEGIN NOW —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake. END
BEGIN NOW From the playfield the boys raised a shout. END
BEGIN NOW A whirring whistle: goal. END
BEGIN NOW What if that nightmare gave you a back kick? END
BEGIN NOW —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW All human END
BEGIN NOW history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —That is God. END
BEGIN NOW Hooray! END
BEGIN NOW Ay! END
BEGIN NOW Whrrwhee! END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy asked. END
BEGIN NOW —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked END
BEGIN NOW between his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Looking up again he set them free. END
BEGIN NOW —I am happier than you are, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We have committed many errors and END
BEGIN NOW many sins. END
BEGIN NOW A woman brought sin into the world. END
BEGIN NOW For a woman who was no END
BEGIN NOW better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten END
BEGIN NOW years the Greeks made war on Troy. END
BEGIN NOW A faithless wife first brought the END
BEGIN NOW strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman, O'Rourke, END
BEGIN NOW prince of Breffni. END
BEGIN NOW A woman too brought Parnell low. END
BEGIN NOW Many errors, many END
BEGIN NOW failures but not the one sin. END
BEGIN NOW I am a struggler now at the end of my END
BEGIN NOW days. END
BEGIN NOW But I will fight for the right till the end. END
BEGIN NOW For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen raised the sheets in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, sir, he began. END
BEGIN NOW —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at END
BEGIN NOW this work. END
BEGIN NOW You were not born to be a teacher, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I am END
BEGIN NOW wrong. END
BEGIN NOW —A learner rather, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW And here what will you learn more? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW —Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW To learn one must be humble. END
BEGIN NOW But life is the great END
BEGIN NOW teacher. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen rustled the sheets again. END
BEGIN NOW —As regards these, he began. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW You have two copies there. END
BEGIN NOW If you can have them END
BEGIN NOW published at once. END
BEGIN NOW Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW Irish Homestead. END
BEGIN NOW —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW I know two editors END
BEGIN NOW slightly. END
BEGIN NOW —That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. END
BEGIN NOW I wrote last night to Mr Field, END
BEGIN NOW M.P. END
BEGIN NOW There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the END
BEGIN NOW City Arms hotel. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW see if you can get it into your two papers. END
BEGIN NOW What are they? END
BEGIN NOW —The Evening Telegraph... END
BEGIN NOW —That will do, Mr Deasy said. END
BEGIN NOW There is no time to lose. END
BEGIN NOW Now I have to END
BEGIN NOW answer that letter from my cousin. END
BEGIN NOW —Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. END
BEGIN NOW I like END
BEGIN NOW to break a lance with you, old as I am. END
BEGIN NOW —Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back. END
BEGIN NOW He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, END
BEGIN NOW hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: END
BEGIN NOW toothless terrors. END
BEGIN NOW Still I will help him in his fight. END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan will dub END
BEGIN NOW me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard. END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Dedalus! END
BEGIN NOW Running after me. END
BEGIN NOW No more letters, I hope. END
BEGIN NOW —Just one moment. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath. END
BEGIN NOW —I just wanted to say, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland, they say, has the honour of END
BEGIN NOW being the only country which never persecuted the jews. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know END
BEGIN NOW that? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW And do you know why? END
BEGIN NOW He frowned sternly on the bright air. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked, beginning to smile. END
BEGIN NOW —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a END
BEGIN NOW rattling chain of phlegm. END
BEGIN NOW He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, END
BEGIN NOW his lifted arms waving to the air. END
BEGIN NOW —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he END
BEGIN NOW stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. END
BEGIN NOW That's why. END
BEGIN NOW On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung END
BEGIN NOW spangles, dancing coins. END
BEGIN NOW [ 3 ] END
BEGIN NOW Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought END
BEGIN NOW through my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn END
BEGIN NOW and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. END
BEGIN NOW Snotgreen, bluesilver, END
BEGIN NOW rust: coloured signs. END
BEGIN NOW Limits of the diaphane. END
BEGIN NOW But he adds: in bodies. END
BEGIN NOW Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW By END
BEGIN NOW knocking his sconce against them, sure. END
BEGIN NOW Go easy. END
BEGIN NOW Bald he was and a END
BEGIN NOW millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. END
BEGIN NOW Limit of the diaphane in. END
BEGIN NOW Why END
BEGIN NOW in? END
BEGIN NOW Diaphane, adiaphane. END
BEGIN NOW If you can put your five fingers through it it END
BEGIN NOW is a gate, if not a door. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes and see. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and END
BEGIN NOW shells. END
BEGIN NOW You are walking through it howsomever. END
BEGIN NOW I am, a stride at a time. END
BEGIN NOW A very short space of time through very short times of space. END
BEGIN NOW Five, six: END
BEGIN NOW the nacheinander. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the END
BEGIN NOW audible. END
BEGIN NOW Open your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus! END
BEGIN NOW If I fell over a cliff that beetles END
BEGIN NOW o'er his base, fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably! END
BEGIN NOW I am getting END
BEGIN NOW on nicely in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW My ash sword hangs at my side. END
BEGIN NOW Tap with it: they END
BEGIN NOW do. END
BEGIN NOW My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, nebeneinander. END
BEGIN NOW Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. END
BEGIN NOW Am I walking into END
BEGIN NOW eternity along Sandymount strand? END
BEGIN NOW Crush, crack, crick, crick. END
BEGIN NOW Wild sea END
BEGIN NOW money. END
BEGIN NOW Dominie Deasy kens them a'. END
BEGIN NOW Won't you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare? END
BEGIN NOW Rhythm begins, you see. END
BEGIN NOW I hear. END
BEGIN NOW Acatalectic tetrameter of iambs END
BEGIN NOW marching. END
BEGIN NOW No, agallop: deline the mare. END
BEGIN NOW Open your eyes now. END
BEGIN NOW I will. END
BEGIN NOW One moment. END
BEGIN NOW Has all vanished since? END
BEGIN NOW If I END
BEGIN NOW open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. END
BEGIN NOW Basta! END
BEGIN NOW I will see if I can END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW See now. END
BEGIN NOW There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world END
BEGIN NOW without end. END
BEGIN NOW They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently, Frauenzimmer: END
BEGIN NOW and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the END
BEGIN NOW silted sand. END
BEGIN NOW Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother. END
BEGIN NOW Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's gamp poked in END
BEGIN NOW the beach. END
BEGIN NOW From the liberties, out for the day. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Florence MacCabe, END
BEGIN NOW relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. END
BEGIN NOW One END
BEGIN NOW of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. END
BEGIN NOW Creation from nothing. END
BEGIN NOW What has she in the bag? END
BEGIN NOW A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in END
BEGIN NOW ruddy wool. END
BEGIN NOW The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all END
BEGIN NOW flesh. END
BEGIN NOW That is why mystic monks. END
BEGIN NOW Will you be as gods? END
BEGIN NOW Gaze in your END
BEGIN NOW omphalos. END
BEGIN NOW Hello! END
BEGIN NOW Kinch here. END
BEGIN NOW Put me on to Edenville. END
BEGIN NOW Aleph, alpha: END
BEGIN NOW nought, nought, one. END
BEGIN NOW Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. END
BEGIN NOW She had no navel. END
BEGIN NOW Gaze. END
BEGIN NOW Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, END
BEGIN NOW whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to END
BEGIN NOW everlasting. END
BEGIN NOW Womb of sin. END
BEGIN NOW Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. END
BEGIN NOW By them, the man END
BEGIN NOW with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. END
BEGIN NOW They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. END
BEGIN NOW From before the ages END
BEGIN NOW He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. END
BEGIN NOW A lex eterna stays END
BEGIN NOW about Him. END
BEGIN NOW Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are END
BEGIN NOW consubstantial? END
BEGIN NOW Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? END
BEGIN NOW Warring his END
BEGIN NOW life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. END
BEGIN NOW Illstarred END
BEGIN NOW heresiarch! END
BEGIN NOW In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. END
BEGIN NOW With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of END
BEGIN NOW a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts. END
BEGIN NOW Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. END
BEGIN NOW They are coming, waves. END
BEGIN NOW The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of END
BEGIN NOW Mananaan. END
BEGIN NOW I mustn't forget his letter for the press. END
BEGIN NOW And after? END
BEGIN NOW The Ship, half END
BEGIN NOW twelve. END
BEGIN NOW By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I must. END
BEGIN NOW His pace slackened. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW Am I going to aunt Sara's or not? END
BEGIN NOW My END
BEGIN NOW consubstantial father's voice. END
BEGIN NOW Did you see anything of your artist END
BEGIN NOW brother Stephen lately? END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace with END
BEGIN NOW his aunt Sally? END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW And and and END
BEGIN NOW and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? END
BEGIN NOW O, weeping God, the things I END
BEGIN NOW married into! END
BEGIN NOW De boys up in de hayloft. END
BEGIN NOW The drunken little costdrawer END
BEGIN NOW and his brother, the cornet player. END
BEGIN NOW Highly respectable gondoliers! END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! END
BEGIN NOW Sir. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! END
BEGIN NOW I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. END
BEGIN NOW They take END
BEGIN NOW me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage. END
BEGIN NOW —It's Stephen, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Let him in. END
BEGIN NOW Let Stephen in. END
BEGIN NOW A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me. END
BEGIN NOW —We thought you were someone else. END
BEGIN NOW In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the END
BEGIN NOW hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. END
BEGIN NOW Cleanchested. END
BEGIN NOW He has washed the END
BEGIN NOW upper moiety. END
BEGIN NOW —Morrow, nephew. END
BEGIN NOW He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the END
BEGIN NOW eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and END
BEGIN NOW common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum. END
BEGIN NOW A bogoak frame over his bald END
BEGIN NOW head: Wilde's Requiescat. END
BEGIN NOW The drone of his misleading whistle brings END
BEGIN NOW Walter back. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir? END
BEGIN NOW —Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. END
BEGIN NOW Where is she? END
BEGIN NOW —Bathing Crissie, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Papa's little bedpal. END
BEGIN NOW Lump of love. END
BEGIN NOW —No, uncle Richie... END
BEGIN NOW —Call me Richie. END
BEGIN NOW Damn your lithia water. END
BEGIN NOW It lowers. END
BEGIN NOW Whusky! END
BEGIN NOW —Uncle Richie, really... END
BEGIN NOW —Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down. END
BEGIN NOW Walter squints vainly for a chair. END
BEGIN NOW —He has nothing to sit down on, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —He has nowhere to put it, you mug. END
BEGIN NOW Bring in our chippendale chair. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a bite of something? END
BEGIN NOW None of your damned lawdeedaw airs END
BEGIN NOW here. END
BEGIN NOW The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? END
BEGIN NOW Sure? END
BEGIN NOW So much the END
BEGIN NOW better. END
BEGIN NOW We have nothing in the house but backache pills. END
BEGIN NOW All'erta! END
BEGIN NOW He drones bars of Ferrando's aria di sortita. END
BEGIN NOW The grandest number, END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, in the whole opera. END
BEGIN NOW Listen. END
BEGIN NOW His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, END
BEGIN NOW his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees. END
BEGIN NOW This wind is sweeter. END
BEGIN NOW Houses of decay, mine, his and all. END
BEGIN NOW You told the Clongowes gentry you END
BEGIN NOW had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. END
BEGIN NOW Come out of END
BEGIN NOW them, Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW Beauty is not there. END
BEGIN NOW Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's END
BEGIN NOW library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. END
BEGIN NOW For whom? END
BEGIN NOW The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. END
BEGIN NOW A hater of his kind ran END
BEGIN NOW from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his END
BEGIN NOW eyeballs stars. END
BEGIN NOW Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. END
BEGIN NOW The oval equine faces, END
BEGIN NOW Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. END
BEGIN NOW Abbas father,—furious END
BEGIN NOW dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? END
BEGIN NOW Paff! END
BEGIN NOW Descende, calve, ut END
BEGIN NOW ne amplius decalveris. END
BEGIN NOW A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see END
BEGIN NOW him me clambering down to the footpace (descende!), clutching a END

BEGIN NOW Get down, baldpoll! END
BEGIN NOW A choir gives back menace END
BEGIN NOW and echo, assisting about the altar's horns, the snorted Latin of END
BEGIN NOW jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, END
BEGIN NOW fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat. END
BEGIN NOW And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW Dringdring! END
BEGIN NOW And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. END
BEGIN NOW Dringadring! END
BEGIN NOW And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own END

BEGIN NOW Dringdring! END
BEGIN NOW Down, up, forward, back. END
BEGIN NOW Dan Occam thought of that, END
BEGIN NOW invincible doctor. END
BEGIN NOW A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled END
BEGIN NOW his brain. END
BEGIN NOW Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his END
BEGIN NOW second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, END
BEGIN NOW rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang END
BEGIN NOW in diphthong. END
BEGIN NOW Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. END
BEGIN NOW Isle of saints. END
BEGIN NOW You were END
BEGIN NOW awfully holy, weren't you? END
BEGIN NOW You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you END
BEGIN NOW might not have a red nose. END
BEGIN NOW You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue END
BEGIN NOW that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the END
BEGIN NOW wet street. END
BEGIN NOW O si, certo! END
BEGIN NOW Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned END
BEGIN NOW round a squaw. END
BEGIN NOW More tell me, more still!! END
BEGIN NOW On the top of the Howth tram END
BEGIN NOW alone crying to the rain: Naked women! END
BEGIN NOW naked women! END
BEGIN NOW What about that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW What about what? END
BEGIN NOW What else were they invented for? END
BEGIN NOW Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? END
BEGIN NOW I was young. END
BEGIN NOW You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause END
BEGIN NOW earnestly, striking face. END
BEGIN NOW Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! END
BEGIN NOW Hray! END
BEGIN NOW No-one END
BEGIN NOW saw: tell no-one. END
BEGIN NOW Books you were going to write with letters for titles. END
BEGIN NOW Have you read his F? END
BEGIN NOW O yes, but I prefer Q. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but W is wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW O END
BEGIN NOW yes, W. END
BEGIN NOW Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply END
BEGIN NOW deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the END

BEGIN NOW Someone was to read them there after a few END
BEGIN NOW thousand years, a mahamanvantara. END
BEGIN NOW Pico della Mirandola like. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, very END
BEGIN NOW like a whale. END
BEGIN NOW When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one END
BEGIN NOW feels that one is at one with one who once... END
BEGIN NOW The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. END
BEGIN NOW His boots trod again a END
BEGIN NOW damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the END
BEGIN NOW unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. END
BEGIN NOW Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing END
BEGIN NOW upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a END
BEGIN NOW midden of man's ashes. END
BEGIN NOW He coasted them, walking warily. END
BEGIN NOW A porterbottle END
BEGIN NOW stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. END
BEGIN NOW A sentinel: END
BEGIN NOW isle of dreadful thirst. END
BEGIN NOW Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze END
BEGIN NOW of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the END
BEGIN NOW higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. END
BEGIN NOW Ringsend: wigwams END
BEGIN NOW of brown steersmen and master mariners. END
BEGIN NOW Human shells. END
BEGIN NOW He halted. END
BEGIN NOW I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. END
BEGIN NOW Am I not going there? END
BEGIN NOW Seems not. END
BEGIN NOW No-one about. END
BEGIN NOW He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand END
BEGIN NOW towards the Pigeonhouse. END
BEGIN NOW —Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position? END
BEGIN NOW —c'est le pigeon, Joseph. END
BEGIN NOW Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon. END
BEGIN NOW Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. END
BEGIN NOW My father's a bird, he END
BEGIN NOW lapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny's face. END
BEGIN NOW Lap, lapin. END
BEGIN NOW He hopes to win in the gros lots. END
BEGIN NOW About the nature of women END
BEGIN NOW he read in Michelet. END
BEGIN NOW But he must send me La Vie de JÃ©sus by M. END
BEGIN NOW LÃ©o END

BEGIN NOW She always kept things decent in The Hannigan famileye. END
BEGIN NOW His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by END

BEGIN NOW Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. END
BEGIN NOW The sun is END

BEGIN NOW The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of END

BEGIN NOW Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, END

BEGIN NOW He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the END

BEGIN NOW Get back END

BEGIN NOW Unheeded he kept by them as END

BEGIN NOW Along by the edge of the mole he END

BEGIN NOW Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and END

BEGIN NOW That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library END

BEGIN NOW His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. END
BEGIN NOW Why not endless till END

BEGIN NOW Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness END

BEGIN NOW Me sits there END

BEGIN NOW Darkness is END
BEGIN NOW in our souls do you not think? END
BEGIN NOW Flutier. END
BEGIN NOW Our souls, shamewounded by our END

BEGIN NOW Into the ineluctable modality of END

BEGIN NOW What she? END
BEGIN NOW The virgin at Hodges END
BEGIN NOW Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you END

BEGIN NOW Wrist through the braided END

BEGIN NOW He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled END

BEGIN NOW His hat down on his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW That is END
BEGIN NOW Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Et END

BEGIN NOW Et erant valde bona. END
BEGIN NOW Alo! END

BEGIN NOW Welcome as the flowers in END

BEGIN NOW Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the END

BEGIN NOW I am caught in this burning scene. END
BEGIN NOW Pan's hour, the faunal END
BEGIN NOW noon. END
BEGIN NOW Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the END
BEGIN NOW tawny waters leaves lie wide. END
BEGIN NOW Pain is far. END
BEGIN NOW And no more turn aside and brood. END
BEGIN NOW His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs, END
BEGIN NOW nebeneinander. END
BEGIN NOW He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein END
BEGIN NOW another's foot had nested warm. END
BEGIN NOW The foot that beat the ground in END
BEGIN NOW tripudium, foot I dislove. END
BEGIN NOW But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's END

BEGIN NOW As I am. END
BEGIN NOW As I END

BEGIN NOW All or not at all. END
BEGIN NOW In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering END
BEGIN NOW greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. END
BEGIN NOW My ashplant will float END
BEGIN NOW away. END
BEGIN NOW I shall wait. END
BEGIN NOW No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the END
BEGIN NOW low rocks, swirling, passing. END
BEGIN NOW Better get this job over quick. END
BEGIN NOW Listen: a END

BEGIN NOW Vehement breath of END
BEGIN NOW waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. END
BEGIN NOW In cups of rocks it slops: END
BEGIN NOW flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. END
BEGIN NOW And, spent, its speech ceases. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling. END
BEGIN NOW Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and END
BEGIN NOW sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water END
BEGIN NOW swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. END
BEGIN NOW Day by day: night by night: END
BEGIN NOW lifted, flooded and let fall. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, END
BEGIN NOW they sigh. END
BEGIN NOW Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, END
BEGIN NOW awaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias END
BEGIN NOW patiens ingemiscit. END
BEGIN NOW To no end gathered; vainly then released, END
BEGIN NOW forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. END

BEGIN NOW There he is. END

BEGIN NOW Pull. END
BEGIN NOW Sunk though he be beneath the watery END

BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW My cockle hat and staff and hismy END

BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW To evening lands. END

BEGIN NOW Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. END

BEGIN NOW Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps? END
BEGIN NOW My handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW He threw it. END
BEGIN NOW I remember. END
BEGIN NOW Did I not take it up? END
BEGIN NOW His hand groped vainly in his pockets. END
BEGIN NOW No, I didn't. END
BEGIN NOW Better buy one. END
BEGIN NOW He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, END
BEGIN NOW carefully. END
BEGIN NOW For the rest let look who will. END
BEGIN NOW Behind. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps there is someone. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. END
BEGIN NOW He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, END
BEGIN NOW liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. END
BEGIN NOW Most of all he END
BEGIN NOW liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of END
BEGIN NOW faintly scented urine. END
BEGIN NOW Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting END
BEGIN NOW her breakfast things on the humpy tray. END
BEGIN NOW Gelid light and air were in the END
BEGIN NOW kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW Made him feel END
BEGIN NOW a bit peckish. END
BEGIN NOW The coals were reddening. END
BEGIN NOW Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't like END
BEGIN NOW her plate full. END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off END
BEGIN NOW the hob and set it sideways on the fire. END
BEGIN NOW It sat there, dull and squat, END
BEGIN NOW its spout stuck out. END
BEGIN NOW Cup of tea soon. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth dry. END
BEGIN NOW The cat walked END
BEGIN NOW stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high. END
BEGIN NOW —Mkgnao! END
BEGIN NOW —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire. END
BEGIN NOW The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the END
BEGIN NOW table, mewing. END
BEGIN NOW Just how she stalks over my writingtable. END
BEGIN NOW Prr. END
BEGIN NOW Scratch my END
BEGIN NOW head. END
BEGIN NOW Prr. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. END
BEGIN NOW Clean to see: END
BEGIN NOW the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her END
BEGIN NOW tail, the green flashing eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He bent down to her, his hands on his END
BEGIN NOW knees. END
BEGIN NOW —Milk for the pussens, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Mrkgnao! END
BEGIN NOW the cat cried. END
BEGIN NOW They call them stupid. END
BEGIN NOW They understand what we say better than we END
BEGIN NOW understand them. END
BEGIN NOW She understands all she wants to. END
BEGIN NOW Vindictive too. END
BEGIN NOW Cruel. END
BEGIN NOW Her nature. END
BEGIN NOW Curious mice never squeal. END
BEGIN NOW Seem to like it. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder END
BEGIN NOW what I look like to her. END
BEGIN NOW Height of a tower? END
BEGIN NOW No, she can jump me. END
BEGIN NOW —Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. END
BEGIN NOW Afraid of the END
BEGIN NOW chookchooks. END
BEGIN NOW I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens. END
BEGIN NOW Cruel. END
BEGIN NOW Her nature. END
BEGIN NOW Curious mice never squeal. END
BEGIN NOW Seem to like it. END
BEGIN NOW —Mrkrgnao! END
BEGIN NOW the cat said loudly. END
BEGIN NOW She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and END
BEGIN NOW long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. END
BEGIN NOW He watched the dark eyeslits END
BEGIN NOW narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. END
BEGIN NOW Then he went to END
BEGIN NOW the dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him, END
BEGIN NOW poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW —Gurrhr! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, running to lap. END
BEGIN NOW He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped END
BEGIN NOW three times and licked lightly. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is it true if you clip them they END
BEGIN NOW can't mouse after. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. END
BEGIN NOW Or END
BEGIN NOW kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW He listened to her licking lap. END
BEGIN NOW Ham and eggs, no. END
BEGIN NOW No good eggs with this END
BEGIN NOW drouth. END
BEGIN NOW Want pure fresh water. END
BEGIN NOW Thursday: not a good day either for a END
BEGIN NOW mutton kidney at Buckley's. END
BEGIN NOW Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Better END
BEGIN NOW a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. END
BEGIN NOW While the kettle is boiling. END
BEGIN NOW She lapped END
BEGIN NOW slower, then licking the saucer clean. END
BEGIN NOW Why are their tongues so rough? END
BEGIN NOW To lap better, all porous holes. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing she can eat? END
BEGIN NOW He glanced round END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by END
BEGIN NOW the bedroom door. END
BEGIN NOW She might like something tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Thin bread and butter END
BEGIN NOW she likes in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Still perhaps: once in a way. END
BEGIN NOW He said softly in the bare hall: END
BEGIN NOW —I'm going round the corner. END
BEGIN NOW Be back in a minute. END
BEGIN NOW And when he had heard his voice say it he added: END
BEGIN NOW —You don't want anything for breakfast? END
BEGIN NOW A sleepy soft grunt answered: END
BEGIN NOW —Mn. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't want anything. END
BEGIN NOW He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, END
BEGIN NOW as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. END
BEGIN NOW Must get those settled really. END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW All the way from Gibraltar. END
BEGIN NOW Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder what her father gave for END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW Old style. END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes! END
BEGIN NOW of course. END
BEGIN NOW Bought it at the governor's auction. END
BEGIN NOW Got a short knock. END
BEGIN NOW Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW At END
BEGIN NOW Plevna that was. END
BEGIN NOW I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. END
BEGIN NOW Still END
BEGIN NOW he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. END
BEGIN NOW Now that was END
BEGIN NOW farseeing. END
BEGIN NOW His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat END
BEGIN NOW and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. END
BEGIN NOW Stamps: stickyback END
BEGIN NOW pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. END
BEGIN NOW Course they do. END
BEGIN NOW The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's END
BEGIN NOW high grade ha. END
BEGIN NOW He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. END
BEGIN NOW White slip END
BEGIN NOW of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Quite safe. END
BEGIN NOW On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. END
BEGIN NOW Not there. END
BEGIN NOW In the trousers I left off. END
BEGIN NOW Must get it. END
BEGIN NOW Potato I have. END
BEGIN NOW Creaky wardrobe. END
BEGIN NOW No use disturbing her. END
BEGIN NOW She turned over sleepily that time. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled the END
BEGIN NOW halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped END
BEGIN NOW gently over the threshold, a limp lid. END
BEGIN NOW Looked shut. END
BEGIN NOW All right till I END
BEGIN NOW come back anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number END
BEGIN NOW seventyfive. END
BEGIN NOW The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. END
BEGIN NOW Be a END
BEGIN NOW warm day I fancy. END
BEGIN NOW Specially in these black clothes feel it more. END

BEGIN NOW What END

BEGIN NOW Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Sad thing about poor END

BEGIN NOW —Good day, Mr O'Rourke. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day to you. END
BEGIN NOW —Lovely weather, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —'Tis all that. END
BEGIN NOW Where do they get the money? END

BEGIN NOW Say he got ten per cent off. END
BEGIN NOW O more. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW He passed Saint END

BEGIN NOW He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages, END
BEGIN NOW polonies, black and white. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen multiplied by. END
BEGIN NOW The figures whitened END
BEGIN NOW in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. END
BEGIN NOW The shiny links, END
BEGIN NOW packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the END
BEGIN NOW lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood. END
BEGIN NOW A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW Would she buy it too, calling END
BEGIN NOW the items from a slip in her hand? END
BEGIN NOW Chapped: washingsoda. END
BEGIN NOW And a pound and END
BEGIN NOW a half of Denny's sausages. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. END
BEGIN NOW Woods END

BEGIN NOW No END

BEGIN NOW Strong pair of arms. END
BEGIN NOW Whacking a carpet on the END
BEGIN NOW clothesline. END
BEGIN NOW She does whack it, by George. END
BEGIN NOW The way her crooked skirt END
BEGIN NOW swings at each whack. END
BEGIN NOW The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with END
BEGIN NOW blotchy fingers, sausagepink. END
BEGIN NOW Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer. END
BEGIN NOW He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at END
BEGIN NOW Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. END
BEGIN NOW Can become ideal winter END
BEGIN NOW sanatorium. END
BEGIN NOW Moses Montefiore. END
BEGIN NOW I thought he was. END
BEGIN NOW Farmhouse, wall round END
BEGIN NOW it, blurred cattle cropping. END
BEGIN NOW He held the page from him: interesting: END
BEGIN NOW read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page END
BEGIN NOW rustling. END
BEGIN NOW A young white heifer. END
BEGIN NOW Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the END
BEGIN NOW beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the END
BEGIN NOW breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm END
BEGIN NOW on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in END
BEGIN NOW their hands. END
BEGIN NOW He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and END
BEGIN NOW his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. END
BEGIN NOW The crooked skirt swinging, END
BEGIN NOW whack by whack by whack. END
BEGIN NOW The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime END
BEGIN NOW sausages and made a red grimace. END
BEGIN NOW —Now, my miss, he said. END
BEGIN NOW She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, my miss. END
BEGIN NOW And one shilling threepence change. END
BEGIN NOW For you, END
BEGIN NOW please? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom pointed quickly. END
BEGIN NOW To catch up and walk behind her if she went END
BEGIN NOW slowly, behind her moving hams. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant to see first thing in the END
BEGIN NOW morning. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry up, damn it. END
BEGIN NOW Make hay while the sun shines. END
BEGIN NOW She stood END
BEGIN NOW outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW sighed down his nose: they never understand. END
BEGIN NOW Sodachapped hands. END
BEGIN NOW Crusted END
BEGIN NOW toenails too. END
BEGIN NOW Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. END
BEGIN NOW For END
BEGIN NOW another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles' Lane. END
BEGIN NOW They like END
BEGIN NOW them sizeable. END
BEGIN NOW Prime sausage. END
BEGIN NOW O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the END
BEGIN NOW wood. END
BEGIN NOW —Threepence, please. END
BEGIN NOW His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them END
BEGIN NOW on the rubber prickles. END
BEGIN NOW They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, END
BEGIN NOW disc by disc, into the till. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Another time. END
BEGIN NOW A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. END
BEGIN NOW He withdrew his gaze END
BEGIN NOW after an instant. END
BEGIN NOW No: better not: another time. END
BEGIN NOW —Good morning, he said, moving away. END
BEGIN NOW —Good morning, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No sign. END
BEGIN NOW Gone. END
BEGIN NOW What matter? END
BEGIN NOW He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath Netaim: END
BEGIN NOW planters' company. END
BEGIN NOW To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish END
BEGIN NOW government and plant with eucalyptus trees. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent for shade, fuel END
BEGIN NOW and construction. END
BEGIN NOW Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. END
BEGIN NOW You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, END
BEGIN NOW oranges, almonds or citrons. END
BEGIN NOW Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial END
BEGIN NOW irrigation. END
BEGIN NOW Every year you get a sending of the crop. END
BEGIN NOW Your name entered END
BEGIN NOW for life as owner in the book of the union. END
BEGIN NOW Can pay ten down and the END
BEGIN NOW balance in yearly instalments. END
BEGIN NOW Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. END
BEGIN NOW 15. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing doing. END
BEGIN NOW Still an idea behind it. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. END
BEGIN NOW Silverpowdered END
BEGIN NOW olivetrees. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. END
BEGIN NOW Olives are packed in END
BEGIN NOW jars, eh? END
BEGIN NOW I have a few left from Andrews. END
BEGIN NOW Molly spitting them out. END
BEGIN NOW Knows END
BEGIN NOW the taste of them now. END
BEGIN NOW Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. END
BEGIN NOW Citrons END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. END
BEGIN NOW And Mastiansky END
BEGIN NOW with the old cither. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant evenings we had then. END
BEGIN NOW Molly in Citron's END
BEGIN NOW basketchair. END
BEGIN NOW Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it END
BEGIN NOW to the nostrils and smell the perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Like that, heavy, sweet, wild END
BEGIN NOW perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Always the same, year after year. END
BEGIN NOW They fetched high prices too, END
BEGIN NOW Moisel told me. END
BEGIN NOW Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. END
BEGIN NOW Must be without a flaw, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, END
BEGIN NOW Mediterranean, the Levant. END
BEGIN NOW Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, END
BEGIN NOW chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in END
BEGIN NOW soiled dungarees. END
BEGIN NOW There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. END
BEGIN NOW How do you? END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. END
BEGIN NOW His back is like that END
BEGIN NOW Norwegian captain's. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if I'll meet him today. END
BEGIN NOW Watering cart. END
BEGIN NOW To END
BEGIN NOW provoke the rain. END
BEGIN NOW On earth as it is in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. END
BEGIN NOW Grey. END
BEGIN NOW Far. END
BEGIN NOW No, not like that. END
BEGIN NOW A barren land, bare waste. END
BEGIN NOW Vulcanic lake, the dead END
BEGIN NOW sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW No wind could lift those END
BEGIN NOW waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. END
BEGIN NOW Brimstone they called it END
BEGIN NOW raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. END
BEGIN NOW All dead END
BEGIN NOW names. END
BEGIN NOW A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. END
BEGIN NOW Old now. END
BEGIN NOW It bore the END
BEGIN NOW oldest, the first race. END
BEGIN NOW A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's, clutching a END
BEGIN NOW naggin bottle by the neck. END
BEGIN NOW The oldest people. END
BEGIN NOW Wandered far away over all END
BEGIN NOW the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born END
BEGIN NOW everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW It lay there now. END
BEGIN NOW Now it could bear no more. END
BEGIN NOW Dead: an old END
BEGIN NOW woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Desolation. END
BEGIN NOW Grey horror seared his flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Folding the page into his pocket he turned END
BEGIN NOW into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. END
BEGIN NOW Cold oils slid along his veins, END
BEGIN NOW chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I am here END
BEGIN NOW now. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I am here now. END
BEGIN NOW Morning mouth bad images. END
BEGIN NOW Got up wrong side of END
BEGIN NOW the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. END
BEGIN NOW On the hands down. END
BEGIN NOW Blotchy brown brick houses. END
BEGIN NOW Number eighty still unlet. END
BEGIN NOW Why is that? END
BEGIN NOW Valuation is only twenty-eight. END
BEGIN NOW Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: END
BEGIN NOW parlour windows plastered with bills. END
BEGIN NOW Plasters on a sore eye. END
BEGIN NOW To smell END
BEGIN NOW the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. END
BEGIN NOW Be near her END
BEGIN NOW ample bedwarmed flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim END
BEGIN NOW sandals, along the brightening footpath. END
BEGIN NOW Runs, she runs to meet me, a END
BEGIN NOW girl with gold hair on the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. END
BEGIN NOW He stooped and gathered END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW His quickened heart slowed at once. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW —Poldy! END
BEGIN NOW Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm END
BEGIN NOW yellow twilight towards her tousled head. END
BEGIN NOW —Who are the letters for? END
BEGIN NOW He looked at them. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Milly. END
BEGIN NOW —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. END
BEGIN NOW And a END
BEGIN NOW letter for you. END
BEGIN NOW He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her END
BEGIN NOW knees. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you want the blind up? END
BEGIN NOW Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her END
BEGIN NOW glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow. END
BEGIN NOW —That do? END
BEGIN NOW he asked, turning. END
BEGIN NOW She was reading the card, propped on her elbow. END
BEGIN NOW —She got the things, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back END
BEGIN NOW slowly with a snug sigh. END
BEGIN NOW —Hurry up with that tea, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm parched. END
BEGIN NOW —The kettle is boiling, he said. END
BEGIN NOW But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled END
BEGIN NOW linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: END
BEGIN NOW —Poldy! END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW —Scald the teapot. END
BEGIN NOW On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. END
BEGIN NOW He scalded and END
BEGIN NOW rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the END
BEGIN NOW kettle then to let the water flow in. END
BEGIN NOW Having set it to draw he took off END
BEGIN NOW the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump END
BEGIN NOW of butter slide and melt. END
BEGIN NOW While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed END
BEGIN NOW hungrily against him. END
BEGIN NOW Give her too much meat she won't mouse. END
BEGIN NOW Say they END
BEGIN NOW won't eat pork. END
BEGIN NOW Kosher. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her END
BEGIN NOW and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Pepper. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup. END
BEGIN NOW Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks: END
BEGIN NOW new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's END
BEGIN NOW seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW The tea was drawn. END
BEGIN NOW He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, END
BEGIN NOW smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Silly Milly's birthday gift. END
BEGIN NOW Only five she was then. END
BEGIN NOW No, wait: END
BEGIN NOW four. END
BEGIN NOW I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. END
BEGIN NOW Putting pieces of END
BEGIN NOW folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled, pouring. END
BEGIN NOW O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling. END
BEGIN NOW You are my lookingglass from night END
BEGIN NOW to morning. END
BEGIN NOW I'd rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with END
BEGIN NOW her ass and garden. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old professor Goodwin. END
BEGIN NOW Dreadful old case. END
BEGIN NOW Still he was a courteous END
BEGIN NOW old chap. END
BEGIN NOW Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW the little mirror in his silk hat. END
BEGIN NOW The night Milly brought it into the END
BEGIN NOW parlour. END
BEGIN NOW O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! END
BEGIN NOW All we END
BEGIN NOW laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Sex breaking out even then. END
BEGIN NOW Pert little piece she was. END
BEGIN NOW He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the END
BEGIN NOW teapot on the tray. END
BEGIN NOW Its hump bumped as he took it up. END
BEGIN NOW Everything on it? END
BEGIN NOW Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He carried it END
BEGIN NOW upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle. END
BEGIN NOW Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on END
BEGIN NOW the chair by the bedhead. END
BEGIN NOW —What a time you were! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on END
BEGIN NOW the pillow. END
BEGIN NOW He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft END
BEGIN NOW bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. END
BEGIN NOW The warmth END
BEGIN NOW of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the END
BEGIN NOW tea she poured. END
BEGIN NOW A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. END
BEGIN NOW In the END
BEGIN NOW act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread. END
BEGIN NOW —Who was the letter from? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand. END
BEGIN NOW Marion. END
BEGIN NOW —O, Boylan, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He's bringing the programme. END
BEGIN NOW —What are you singing? END
BEGIN NOW —LÃ  ci darem with J. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW Doyle, she said, and Love's Old Sweet Song. END
BEGIN NOW Her full lips, drinking, smiled. END
BEGIN NOW Rather stale smell that incense leaves END
BEGIN NOW next day. END
BEGIN NOW Like foul flowerwater. END
BEGIN NOW —Would you like the window open a little? END
BEGIN NOW She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: END
BEGIN NOW —What time is the funeral? END
BEGIN NOW —Eleven, I think, he answered. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't see the paper. END
BEGIN NOW Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled END
BEGIN NOW drawers from the bed. END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a END
BEGIN NOW stocking: rumpled, shiny sole. END
BEGIN NOW —No: that book. END
BEGIN NOW Other stocking. END
BEGIN NOW Her petticoat. END
BEGIN NOW —It must have fell down, she said. END
BEGIN NOW He felt here and there. END
BEGIN NOW Voglio e non vorrei. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if she pronounces END
BEGIN NOW that right: voglio. END
BEGIN NOW Not in the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Must have slid down. END
BEGIN NOW He stooped and END
BEGIN NOW lifted the valance. END
BEGIN NOW The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the END
BEGIN NOW orangekeyed chamberpot. END
BEGIN NOW —Show here, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I put a mark in it. END
BEGIN NOW There's a word I wanted to ask END
BEGIN NOW you. END
BEGIN NOW She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, END
BEGIN NOW having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the END
BEGIN NOW text with the hairpin till she reached the word. END
BEGIN NOW —Met him what? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Here, she said. END
BEGIN NOW What does that mean? END
BEGIN NOW He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail. END
BEGIN NOW —Metempsychosis? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Who's he when he's at home? END
BEGIN NOW —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. END
BEGIN NOW It's Greek: from the Greek. END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW means the transmigration of souls. END
BEGIN NOW —O, rocks! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW Tell us in plain words. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The same young eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The first night after the charades. END
BEGIN NOW Dolphin's Barn. END
BEGIN NOW He turned over the END
BEGIN NOW smudged pages. END
BEGIN NOW Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Illustration. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce END
BEGIN NOW Italian with carriagewhip. END
BEGIN NOW Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked. END
BEGIN NOW Sheet kindly lent. END
BEGIN NOW The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from END
BEGIN NOW him with an oath. END
BEGIN NOW Cruelty behind it all. END
BEGIN NOW Doped animals. END
BEGIN NOW Trapeze at END
BEGIN NOW Hengler's. END
BEGIN NOW Had to look the other way. END
BEGIN NOW Mob gaping. END
BEGIN NOW Break your neck and END
BEGIN NOW we'll break our sides. END
BEGIN NOW Families of them. END
BEGIN NOW Bone them young so they END
BEGIN NOW metamspychosis. END
BEGIN NOW That we live after death. END
BEGIN NOW Our souls. END
BEGIN NOW That a man's soul END
BEGIN NOW after he dies. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam's soul... END
BEGIN NOW —Did you finish it? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, she said. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing smutty in it. END
BEGIN NOW Is she in love with the END
BEGIN NOW first fellow all the time? END
BEGIN NOW —Never read it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want another? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Get another of Paul de Kock's. END
BEGIN NOW Nice name he has. END
BEGIN NOW She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways. END
BEGIN NOW Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to END
BEGIN NOW Kearney, my guarantor. END
BEGIN NOW Reincarnation: that's the word. END
BEGIN NOW —Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body END
BEGIN NOW after death, that we lived before. END
BEGIN NOW They call it reincarnation. END
BEGIN NOW That we END
BEGIN NOW all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other END
BEGIN NOW planet. END
BEGIN NOW They say we have forgotten it. END
BEGIN NOW Some say they remember their past END
BEGIN NOW lives. END
BEGIN NOW The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. END
BEGIN NOW Better remind END
BEGIN NOW her of the word: metempsychosis. END
BEGIN NOW An example would be better. END
BEGIN NOW An example? END
BEGIN NOW The Bath of the Nymph over the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Given away with the Easter number of END
BEGIN NOW Photo Bits: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. END
BEGIN NOW Tea before you put milk END
BEGIN NOW in. END
BEGIN NOW Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. END
BEGIN NOW Three and six I gave for END
BEGIN NOW the frame. END
BEGIN NOW She said it would look nice over the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Naked nymphs: END
BEGIN NOW Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then. END
BEGIN NOW He turned the pages back. END
BEGIN NOW —Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for END
BEGIN NOW instance. END
BEGIN NOW What they called nymphs, for example. END
BEGIN NOW Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. END
BEGIN NOW She gazed straight before her, END
BEGIN NOW inhaling through her arched nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW —There's a smell of burn, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Did you leave anything on the fire? END
BEGIN NOW —The kidney! END
BEGIN NOW he cried suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes END
BEGIN NOW against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping END
BEGIN NOW hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. END
BEGIN NOW Pungent smoke shot END
BEGIN NOW up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. END
BEGIN NOW By prodding a prong of the END
BEGIN NOW fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. END
BEGIN NOW Only a little burnt. END
BEGIN NOW He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the END
BEGIN NOW scanty brown gravy trickle over it. END
BEGIN NOW Cup of tea now. END
BEGIN NOW He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. END
BEGIN NOW Then he put a END
BEGIN NOW forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant END
BEGIN NOW meat. END
BEGIN NOW Done to a turn. END
BEGIN NOW A mouthful of tea. END
BEGIN NOW Then he cut away dies of bread, END
BEGIN NOW sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW What was that about END
BEGIN NOW some young student and a picnic? END
BEGIN NOW He creased out the letter at his side, END
BEGIN NOW reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the END
BEGIN NOW gravy and raising it to his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Papli END
BEGIN NOW Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. END
BEGIN NOW It suits me END
BEGIN NOW splendid. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. END
BEGIN NOW I got END
BEGIN NOW mummy's Iovely box of creams and am writing. END

BEGIN NOW Separation. END
BEGIN NOW Remember the summer morning she was END
BEGIN NOW born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. END
BEGIN NOW Jolly old END
BEGIN NOW woman. END
BEGIN NOW Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. END
BEGIN NOW She knew from END
BEGIN NOW the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. END
BEGIN NOW Well, God is good, sir. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW knew at once. END
BEGIN NOW He would be eleven now if he had lived. END
BEGIN NOW His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse bad writing. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry. END
BEGIN NOW Piano downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Coming out of her shell. END
BEGIN NOW Row with her in the XL END
BEGIN NOW CafÃ© about the bracelet. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look. END
BEGIN NOW Saucebox. END
BEGIN NOW He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after END
BEGIN NOW piece of kidney. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve and six a week. END
BEGIN NOW Not much. END
BEGIN NOW Still, she might do END
BEGIN NOW worse. END
BEGIN NOW Music hall stage. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW He drank a draught of cooler tea END
BEGIN NOW to wash down his meal. END
BEGIN NOW Then he read the letter again: twice. END
BEGIN NOW O, well: she knows how to mind herself. END
BEGIN NOW But if not? END
BEGIN NOW No, nothing has END
BEGIN NOW happened. END
BEGIN NOW Of course it might. END
BEGIN NOW Wait in any case till it does. END
BEGIN NOW A wild END
BEGIN NOW piece of goods. END
BEGIN NOW Her slim legs running up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW Destiny. END
BEGIN NOW Ripening now. END
BEGIN NOW Vain: very. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. END
BEGIN NOW Day I caught END
BEGIN NOW her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. END
BEGIN NOW Anemic a little. END
BEGIN NOW Was given milk too long. END
BEGIN NOW On the Erin's King that day round the Kish. END
BEGIN NOW Damned old tub pitching about. END
BEGIN NOW Not a bit funky. END
BEGIN NOW Her pale blue scarf END
BEGIN NOW loose in the wind with her hair. END
BEGIN NOW All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls. END
BEGIN NOW Seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Torn envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets, END
BEGIN NOW jarvey off for the day, singing. END
BEGIN NOW Friend of the family. END
BEGIN NOW Swurls, he says. END
BEGIN NOW Pier with lamps, summer evening, band. END
BEGIN NOW Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Milly too. END
BEGIN NOW Young kisses: the first. END
BEGIN NOW Far away now past. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, END
BEGIN NOW braiding. END
BEGIN NOW A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. END
BEGIN NOW Will happen, END
BEGIN NOW yes. END
BEGIN NOW Prevent. END
BEGIN NOW Useless: can't move. END
BEGIN NOW Girl's sweet light lips. END
BEGIN NOW Will happen END
BEGIN NOW too. END

BEGIN NOW Useless to move now. END
BEGIN NOW Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. END
BEGIN NOW Full gluey woman's lips. END
BEGIN NOW Better where she is down there: away. END
BEGIN NOW Occupy her. END
BEGIN NOW Wanted a dog to pass END

BEGIN NOW Might take a trip down there. END
BEGIN NOW August bank holiday, only two END
BEGIN NOW and six return. END
BEGIN NOW Six weeks off, however. END
BEGIN NOW Might work a press pass. END
BEGIN NOW Or END
BEGIN NOW through M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, END
BEGIN NOW nosed at it and stalked to the door. END
BEGIN NOW She looked back at him, mewing. END
BEGIN NOW Wants to go out. END
BEGIN NOW Wait before a door sometime it will open. END
BEGIN NOW Let her wait. END
BEGIN NOW Has the fidgets. END
BEGIN NOW Electric. END
BEGIN NOW Thunder in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Was washing at her ear END
BEGIN NOW with her back to the fire too. END
BEGIN NOW He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up, END
BEGIN NOW undoing the waistband of his trousers. END
BEGIN NOW The cat mewed to him. END
BEGIN NOW —Miaow! END
BEGIN NOW he said in answer. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I'm ready. END
BEGIN NOW Heaviness: hot day coming. END
BEGIN NOW Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the END
BEGIN NOW landing. END
BEGIN NOW A paper. END
BEGIN NOW He liked to read at stool. END
BEGIN NOW Hope no ape comes knocking just as END
BEGIN NOW I'm. END
BEGIN NOW In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. END
BEGIN NOW He folded it under END
BEGIN NOW his armpit, went to the door and opened it. END
BEGIN NOW The cat went up in soft END
BEGIN NOW bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Listening, he heard her voice: END
BEGIN NOW —Come, come, pussy. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen END
BEGIN NOW towards the next garden. END
BEGIN NOW No sound. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. END
BEGIN NOW The maid was in the garden. END
BEGIN NOW Fine morning. END
BEGIN NOW He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Make a summerhouse here. END
BEGIN NOW Scarlet runners. END
BEGIN NOW Virginia creepers. END
BEGIN NOW Want to END
BEGIN NOW manure the whole place over, scabby soil. END
BEGIN NOW A coat of liver of sulphur. END
BEGIN NOW All soil like that without dung. END
BEGIN NOW Household slops. END
BEGIN NOW Loam, what is this END
BEGIN NOW that is? END
BEGIN NOW The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top END
BEGIN NOW dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are END
BEGIN NOW fed on those oilcakes. END
BEGIN NOW Mulch of dung. END
BEGIN NOW Best thing to clean ladies' kid END
BEGIN NOW gloves. END
BEGIN NOW Dirty cleans. END
BEGIN NOW Ashes too. END
BEGIN NOW Reclaim the whole place. END
BEGIN NOW Grow peas in END
BEGIN NOW that corner there. END
BEGIN NOW Lettuce. END
BEGIN NOW Always have fresh greens then. END
BEGIN NOW Still gardens END
BEGIN NOW have their drawbacks. END
BEGIN NOW That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday. END
BEGIN NOW He walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my hat, by the way? END
BEGIN NOW Must have put it back on the END
BEGIN NOW peg. END
BEGIN NOW Or hanging up on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Funny I don't remember that. END
BEGIN NOW Hallstand END
BEGIN NOW too full. END
BEGIN NOW Four umbrellas, her raincloak. END
BEGIN NOW Picking up the letters. END
BEGIN NOW Drago's END
BEGIN NOW shopbell ringing. END
BEGIN NOW Queer I was just thinking that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Brown END
BEGIN NOW brillantined hair over his collar. END
BEGIN NOW Just had a wash and brushup. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder END
BEGIN NOW have I time for a bath this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Tara street. END
BEGIN NOW Chap in the paybox END
BEGIN NOW there got away James Stephens, they say. END
BEGIN NOW O'Brien. END
BEGIN NOW Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Now, my miss. END
BEGIN NOW Enthusiast. END
BEGIN NOW He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. END
BEGIN NOW Better be careful not to get END
BEGIN NOW these trousers dirty for the funeral. END
BEGIN NOW He went in, bowing his head under END
BEGIN NOW the low lintel. END
BEGIN NOW Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy END
BEGIN NOW limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. END
BEGIN NOW Before sitting down he END
BEGIN NOW peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. END
BEGIN NOW The king was in his END
BEGIN NOW countinghouse. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody. END
BEGIN NOW Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over END
BEGIN NOW on his bared knees. END
BEGIN NOW Something new and easy. END
BEGIN NOW No great hurry. END
BEGIN NOW Keep it a END
BEGIN NOW bit. END
BEGIN NOW Our prize titbit: Matcham's Masterstroke. END
BEGIN NOW Written by Mr Philip END
BEGIN NOW Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. END
BEGIN NOW Payment at the rate of one guinea a END
BEGIN NOW column has been made to the writer. END
BEGIN NOW Three and a half. END
BEGIN NOW Three pounds END
BEGIN NOW three. END
BEGIN NOW Three pounds, thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but END
BEGIN NOW resisting, began the second. END
BEGIN NOW Midway, his last resistance yielding, he END
BEGIN NOW allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still END
BEGIN NOW patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. END
BEGIN NOW Hope it's END
BEGIN NOW not too big bring on piles again. END
BEGIN NOW No, just right. END
BEGIN NOW So. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Costive. END
BEGIN NOW One END
BEGIN NOW tabloid of cascara sagrada. END
BEGIN NOW Life might be so. END
BEGIN NOW It did not move or touch END
BEGIN NOW him but it was something quick and neat. END
BEGIN NOW Print anything now. END
BEGIN NOW Silly END
BEGIN NOW season. END
BEGIN NOW He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. END
BEGIN NOW Neat END
BEGIN NOW certainly. END
BEGIN NOW Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the END
BEGIN NOW laughing witch who now. END
BEGIN NOW Begins and ends morally. END
BEGIN NOW Hand in hand. END
BEGIN NOW Smart. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow END
BEGIN NOW quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received END
BEGIN NOW payment of three pounds, thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW Might manage a sketch. END
BEGIN NOW By Mr and Mrs L. END
BEGIN NOW M. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Invent a story for END
BEGIN NOW some proverb. END
BEGIN NOW Which? END
BEGIN NOW Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she END
BEGIN NOW said dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Dislike dressing together. END
BEGIN NOW Nicked myself shaving. END
BEGIN NOW Biting END
BEGIN NOW her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. END
BEGIN NOW Timing her. END
BEGIN NOW 9.15. END
BEGIN NOW Did END
BEGIN NOW Roberts pay you yet? END
BEGIN NOW 9.20. END
BEGIN NOW What had Gretta Conroy on? END
BEGIN NOW 9.23. END
BEGIN NOW What END
BEGIN NOW possessed me to buy this comb? END
BEGIN NOW 9.24. END
BEGIN NOW I'm swelled after that cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot. END
BEGIN NOW Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. END
BEGIN NOW Morning END
BEGIN NOW after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the END
BEGIN NOW hours. END
BEGIN NOW Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then END
BEGIN NOW night hours. END
BEGIN NOW Washing her teeth. END
BEGIN NOW That was the first night. END
BEGIN NOW Her head END
BEGIN NOW dancing. END
BEGIN NOW Her fansticks clicking. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Boylan well off? END
BEGIN NOW He has money. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. END
BEGIN NOW No use END
BEGIN NOW humming then. END
BEGIN NOW Allude to it. END
BEGIN NOW Strange kind of music that last night. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW mirror was in shadow. END
BEGIN NOW She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen END
BEGIN NOW vest against her full wagging bub. END
BEGIN NOW Peering into it. END
BEGIN NOW Lines in her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW It wouldn't pan out somehow. END
BEGIN NOW Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. END
BEGIN NOW Night hours then: black with daggers END
BEGIN NOW and eyemasks. END
BEGIN NOW Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. END
BEGIN NOW Still, true to life also. END
BEGIN NOW Day: then the night. END
BEGIN NOW He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. END
BEGIN NOW Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled END
BEGIN NOW back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom END
BEGIN NOW into the air. END
BEGIN NOW In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his END
BEGIN NOW black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. END
BEGIN NOW What time END
BEGIN NOW is the funeral? END
BEGIN NOW Better find out in the paper. END
BEGIN NOW A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. END
BEGIN NOW The bells of George's END
BEGIN NOW church. END
BEGIN NOW They tolled the hour: loud dark iron. END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Heigho! END
BEGIN NOW Quarter to. END
BEGIN NOW There again: the overtone following through the air, third. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam! END
BEGIN NOW [ 5 ] END
BEGIN NOW By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past END
BEGIN NOW Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office. END
BEGIN NOW Could have given that address too. END
BEGIN NOW And past the sailors' home. END
BEGIN NOW He turned END
BEGIN NOW from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street. END
BEGIN NOW By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal END
BEGIN NOW linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. END
BEGIN NOW A smaller girl with scars of eczema on END
BEGIN NOW her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. END
BEGIN NOW Tell END
BEGIN NOW him if he smokes he won't grow. END
BEGIN NOW O let him! END
BEGIN NOW His life isn't such a bed of END
BEGIN NOW roses. END
BEGIN NOW Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. END
BEGIN NOW Come home to ma, da. END
BEGIN NOW Slack END
BEGIN NOW hour: won't be many there. END
BEGIN NOW He crossed Townsend street, passed the END
BEGIN NOW frowning face of Bethel. END
BEGIN NOW El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. END
BEGIN NOW And past END
BEGIN NOW Nichols' the undertaker. END
BEGIN NOW At eleven it is. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay Corny END
BEGIN NOW Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. END
BEGIN NOW Singing with his eyes shut. END
BEGIN NOW Corny. END
BEGIN NOW Met her once in the park. END
BEGIN NOW In the dark. END
BEGIN NOW What a lark. END
BEGIN NOW Police tout. END
BEGIN NOW Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay. END
BEGIN NOW O, END
BEGIN NOW surely he bagged it. END
BEGIN NOW Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. END
BEGIN NOW With my END
BEGIN NOW tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom. END
BEGIN NOW In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental END
BEGIN NOW Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, END
BEGIN NOW finest quality, family tea. END
BEGIN NOW Rather warm. END
BEGIN NOW Tea. END
BEGIN NOW Must get some from Tom END
BEGIN NOW Kernan. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. END
BEGIN NOW While his eyes still read END
BEGIN NOW blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his END
BEGIN NOW right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. END
BEGIN NOW Very warm morning. END
BEGIN NOW Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather END
BEGIN NOW headband inside his high grade ha. END
BEGIN NOW Just there. END
BEGIN NOW His right hand came down END
BEGIN NOW into the bowl of his hat. END
BEGIN NOW His fingers found quickly a card behind the END
BEGIN NOW headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket. END
BEGIN NOW So warm. END
BEGIN NOW His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and END
BEGIN NOW hair. END
BEGIN NOW Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice END
BEGIN NOW blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. END
BEGIN NOW The far east. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely spot it END
BEGIN NOW must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, END
BEGIN NOW cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is it like END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not END
BEGIN NOW doing a hand's turn all day. END
BEGIN NOW Sleep six months out of twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Too hot to END
BEGIN NOW quarrel. END
BEGIN NOW Influence of the climate. END
BEGIN NOW Lethargy. END
BEGIN NOW Flowers of idleness. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW air feeds most. END
BEGIN NOW Azotes. END
BEGIN NOW Hothouse in Botanic gardens. END
BEGIN NOW Sensitive plants. END
BEGIN NOW Waterlilies. END
BEGIN NOW Petals too tired to. END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping sickness in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Walk on END
BEGIN NOW roseleaves. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. END
BEGIN NOW Where was the chap END
BEGIN NOW I saw in that picture somewhere? END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his END
BEGIN NOW back, reading a book with a parasol open. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't sink if you tried: so END
BEGIN NOW thick with salt. END
BEGIN NOW Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the END
BEGIN NOW body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it the END
BEGIN NOW volume is equal to the weight? END
BEGIN NOW It's a law something like that. END
BEGIN NOW Vance in END
BEGIN NOW High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. END
BEGIN NOW The college curriculum. END
BEGIN NOW Cracking curriculum. END
BEGIN NOW What is weight really when you say the weight? END
BEGIN NOW Thirtytwo feet per second per second. END
BEGIN NOW Law of falling bodies: per second END
BEGIN NOW per second. END
BEGIN NOW They all fall to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW The earth. END
BEGIN NOW It's the force of END
BEGIN NOW gravity of the earth is the weight. END
BEGIN NOW He turned away and sauntered across the road. END
BEGIN NOW How did she walk with her END
BEGIN NOW sausages? END
BEGIN NOW Like that something. END
BEGIN NOW As he walked he took the folded Freeman END
BEGIN NOW from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and END
BEGIN NOW tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. END
BEGIN NOW Careless air: END
BEGIN NOW just drop in to see. END
BEGIN NOW Per second per second. END
BEGIN NOW Per second for every second END
BEGIN NOW it means. END
BEGIN NOW From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of END
BEGIN NOW the postoffice. END
BEGIN NOW Too late box. END
BEGIN NOW Post here. END
BEGIN NOW No-one. END
BEGIN NOW In. END
BEGIN NOW He handed the card through the brass grill. END
BEGIN NOW —Are there any letters for me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting END
BEGIN NOW poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his END
BEGIN NOW baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. END
BEGIN NOW No answer END
BEGIN NOW probably. END
BEGIN NOW Went too far last time. END
BEGIN NOW The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a END
BEGIN NOW letter. END
BEGIN NOW He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Henry Flower Esq, c/o P. END
BEGIN NOW O. END
BEGIN NOW Westland Row, City. END
BEGIN NOW Answered anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, END
BEGIN NOW reviewing again the soldiers on parade. END
BEGIN NOW Where's old Tweedy's regiment? END
BEGIN NOW Castoff soldier. END
BEGIN NOW There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. END
BEGIN NOW No, he's a END
BEGIN NOW grenadier. END
BEGIN NOW Pointed cuffs. END
BEGIN NOW There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. END
BEGIN NOW Redcoats. END
BEGIN NOW Too showy. END
BEGIN NOW That must be why the women go after them. END
BEGIN NOW Uniform. END
BEGIN NOW Easier to END
BEGIN NOW enlist and drill. END
BEGIN NOW Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off O'Connell END
BEGIN NOW street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. END
BEGIN NOW Griffith's paper is on END
BEGIN NOW the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or END
BEGIN NOW halfseasover empire. END
BEGIN NOW Half baked they look: hypnotised like. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes front. END
BEGIN NOW Mark time. END
BEGIN NOW Table: able. END
BEGIN NOW Bed: ed. END
BEGIN NOW The King's own. END
BEGIN NOW Never see him dressed END
BEGIN NOW up as a fireman or a bobby. END
BEGIN NOW A mason, yes. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. END
BEGIN NOW Talk: as if END
BEGIN NOW that would mend matters. END
BEGIN NOW His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger END
BEGIN NOW felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. END
BEGIN NOW Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. END
BEGIN NOW His fingers drew forth the END
BEGIN NOW letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Something END
BEGIN NOW pinned on: photo perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Hair? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Get rid of him quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Take me out of my way. END
BEGIN NOW Hate company when END
BEGIN NOW you. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you off to? END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere in particular. END
BEGIN NOW —How's the body? END
BEGIN NOW —Fine. END
BEGIN NOW How are you? END
BEGIN NOW —Just keeping alive, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: END
BEGIN NOW —Is there any... END
BEGIN NOW no trouble I hope? END
BEGIN NOW I see you're... END
BEGIN NOW —O, no, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam, you know. END
BEGIN NOW The funeral is today. END
BEGIN NOW —To be sure, poor fellow. END
BEGIN NOW So it is. END
BEGIN NOW What time? END
BEGIN NOW A photo it isn't. END
BEGIN NOW A badge maybe. END
BEGIN NOW —E... END
BEGIN NOW eleven, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW —I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW Eleven, is it? END
BEGIN NOW I only heard it END
BEGIN NOW last night. END
BEGIN NOW Who was telling me? END
BEGIN NOW Holohan. END
BEGIN NOW You know Hoppy? END
BEGIN NOW —I know. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door END
BEGIN NOW of the Grosvenor. END
BEGIN NOW The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, END
BEGIN NOW searched his pockets for change. END
BEGIN NOW Stylish kind of coat with that roll END
BEGIN NOW collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. END
BEGIN NOW Careless END
BEGIN NOW stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. END
BEGIN NOW Like that haughty END
BEGIN NOW creature at the polo match. END
BEGIN NOW Women all for caste till you touch the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Handsome is and handsome does. END
BEGIN NOW Reserved about to yield. END
BEGIN NOW The honourable END
BEGIN NOW Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. END
BEGIN NOW Possess her once take the starch END
BEGIN NOW out of her. END
BEGIN NOW —I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do END
BEGIN NOW you call him Bantam Lyons. END
BEGIN NOW Just down there in Conway's we were. END
BEGIN NOW Doran Lyons in Conway's. END
BEGIN NOW She raised a gloved hand to her hair. END
BEGIN NOW In came END
BEGIN NOW Hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW Having a wet. END
BEGIN NOW Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath END
BEGIN NOW his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the END
BEGIN NOW braided drums. END
BEGIN NOW Clearly I can see today. END
BEGIN NOW Moisture about gives long sight END
BEGIN NOW perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Talking of one thing or another. END
BEGIN NOW Lady's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Which side will END
BEGIN NOW she get up? END
BEGIN NOW —And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! END
BEGIN NOW What Paddy? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW Poor little Paddy Dignam, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Off to the country: Broadstone probably. END
BEGIN NOW High brown boots with laces END
BEGIN NOW dangling. END
BEGIN NOW Wellturned foot. END
BEGIN NOW What is he foostering over that change for? END
BEGIN NOW Sees me looking. END
BEGIN NOW Eye out for other fellow always. END
BEGIN NOW Good fallback. END
BEGIN NOW Two END
BEGIN NOW strings to her bow. END
BEGIN NOW —Why? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW What's wrong with him? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW Proud: rich: silk stockings. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. END
BEGIN NOW Getting up in a END
BEGIN NOW minute. END
BEGIN NOW —What's wrong with him? END
BEGIN NOW He said. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And, faith, he END
BEGIN NOW filled up. END
BEGIN NOW Is it Paddy Dignam? END
BEGIN NOW I said. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't believe it when I END
BEGIN NOW heard it. END
BEGIN NOW I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in END
BEGIN NOW the Arch. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he said. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone. END
BEGIN NOW He died on Monday, poor fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Silk flash rich stockings white. END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between. END
BEGIN NOW Lost it. END
BEGIN NOW Curse your noisy pugnose. END
BEGIN NOW Feels locked out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Paradise and END
BEGIN NOW the peri. END
BEGIN NOW Always happening like that. END
BEGIN NOW The very moment. END
BEGIN NOW Girl in Eustace END
BEGIN NOW street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. END
BEGIN NOW Her friend covering END
BEGIN NOW the display of esprit de corps. END
BEGIN NOW Well, what are you gaping at? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. END
BEGIN NOW Another gone. END
BEGIN NOW —One of the best, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The tram passed. END
BEGIN NOW They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich END
BEGIN NOW gloved hand on the steel grip. END
BEGIN NOW Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her END
BEGIN NOW hat in the sun: flicker, flick. END
BEGIN NOW —Wife well, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy's changed voice said. END
BEGIN NOW —O, yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Tiptop, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: END
BEGIN NOW What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat? END
BEGIN NOW Incomplete. END
BEGIN NOW With it an END
BEGIN NOW abode of bliss. END
BEGIN NOW —My missus has just got an engagement. END
BEGIN NOW At least it's not settled yet. END
BEGIN NOW Valise tack again. END
BEGIN NOW By the way no harm. END
BEGIN NOW I'm off that, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness. END
BEGIN NOW —My wife too, he said. END
BEGIN NOW She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the END
BEGIN NOW Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twenty-fifth. END
BEGIN NOW —That so? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW Glad to hear that, old man. END
BEGIN NOW Who's getting it up? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Marion Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Not up yet. END
BEGIN NOW Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. END
BEGIN NOW No book. END
BEGIN NOW Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. END
BEGIN NOW Dark lady END
BEGIN NOW and fair man. END
BEGIN NOW Letter. END
BEGIN NOW Cat furry black ball. END
BEGIN NOW Torn strip of envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Love's Old Sweet Song Comes lo-ove's old... END
BEGIN NOW —It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully. END
BEGIN NOW Sweeeet song. END
BEGIN NOW There's a committee formed. END
BEGIN NOW Part shares and part profits. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble. END
BEGIN NOW —O, well, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That's good news. END
BEGIN NOW He moved to go. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Meet you knocking around. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell you what, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW You might put down my name at the funeral, END
BEGIN NOW will you? END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. END
BEGIN NOW There's a END
BEGIN NOW drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself END
BEGIN NOW would have to go down if the body is found. END
BEGIN NOW You just shove in my name if END
BEGIN NOW I'm not there, will you? END
BEGIN NOW —I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all right. END
BEGIN NOW —Right, M'Coy said brightly. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, old man. END
BEGIN NOW I'd go if I possibly END
BEGIN NOW could. END
BEGIN NOW Well, tolloll. END
BEGIN NOW Just C. END
BEGIN NOW P. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy will do. END
BEGIN NOW —That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. END
BEGIN NOW The quick touch. END
BEGIN NOW Soft mark. END
BEGIN NOW I'd END
BEGIN NOW like my job. END
BEGIN NOW Valise I have a particular fancy for. END
BEGIN NOW Leather. END
BEGIN NOW Capped END
BEGIN NOW corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. END
BEGIN NOW Bob Cowley lent him END
BEGIN NOW his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of END
BEGIN NOW it from that good day to this. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. END
BEGIN NOW My missus has just END
BEGIN NOW got an. END
BEGIN NOW Reedy freckled soprano. END
BEGIN NOW Cheeseparing nose. END
BEGIN NOW Nice enough in its END
BEGIN NOW way: for a little ballad. END
BEGIN NOW No guts in it. END
BEGIN NOW You and me, don't you know: in END
BEGIN NOW the same boat. END
BEGIN NOW Softsoaping. END
BEGIN NOW Give you the needle that would. END
BEGIN NOW Can't he END
BEGIN NOW hear the difference? END
BEGIN NOW Think he's that way inclined a bit. END
BEGIN NOW Against my END
BEGIN NOW grain somehow. END
BEGIN NOW Thought that Belfast would fetch him. END
BEGIN NOW I hope that END
BEGIN NOW smallpox up there doesn't get worse. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose she wouldn't let herself be END
BEGIN NOW vaccinated again. END
BEGIN NOW Your wife and my wife. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is he pimping after me? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured END
BEGIN NOW hoardings. END
BEGIN NOW Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). END
BEGIN NOW Clery's Summer END
BEGIN NOW Sale. END
BEGIN NOW No, he's going on straight. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Leah tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Bandmann END
BEGIN NOW Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW Like to see her again in that. END
BEGIN NOW Hamlet she played last night. END
BEGIN NOW Male impersonator. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps he was a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Why Ophelia committed END
BEGIN NOW suicide. END
BEGIN NOW Poor papa! END
BEGIN NOW How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. END
BEGIN NOW Outside END
BEGIN NOW the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. END
BEGIN NOW Year before I END
BEGIN NOW was born that was: sixtyfive. END
BEGIN NOW And Ristori in Vienna. END
BEGIN NOW What is this the END
BEGIN NOW right name is? END
BEGIN NOW By Mosenthal it is. END
BEGIN NOW Rachel, is it? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The scene he was END
BEGIN NOW always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice END
BEGIN NOW and puts his fingers on his face. END
BEGIN NOW Nathan's voice! END
BEGIN NOW His son's voice! END
BEGIN NOW I hear the voice of Nathan who left his END
BEGIN NOW father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his END
BEGIN NOW father and left the God of his father. END
BEGIN NOW Every word is so deep, Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW Poor papa! END
BEGIN NOW Poor man! END
BEGIN NOW I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his END
BEGIN NOW face. END
BEGIN NOW That day! END
BEGIN NOW O, dear! END
BEGIN NOW O, dear! END
BEGIN NOW Ffoo! END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps it was best for END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the END
BEGIN NOW hazard. END
BEGIN NOW No use thinking of it any more. END
BEGIN NOW Nosebag time. END
BEGIN NOW Wish I hadn't met END
BEGIN NOW that M'Coy fellow. END
BEGIN NOW He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing END
BEGIN NOW teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet END
BEGIN NOW oaten reek of horsepiss. END
BEGIN NOW Their Eldorado. END
BEGIN NOW Poor jugginses! END
BEGIN NOW Damn all they END
BEGIN NOW know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. END
BEGIN NOW Too END
BEGIN NOW full for words. END
BEGIN NOW Still they get their feed all right and their doss. END
BEGIN NOW Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their END
BEGIN NOW haunches. END
BEGIN NOW Might be happy all the same that way. END
BEGIN NOW Good poor brutes they END
BEGIN NOW look. END
BEGIN NOW Still their neigh can be very irritating. END
BEGIN NOW He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he END
BEGIN NOW carried. END
BEGIN NOW Might just walk into her here. END
BEGIN NOW The lane is safer. END
BEGIN NOW He passed the cabman's shelter. END
BEGIN NOW Curious the life of drifting cabbies. END
BEGIN NOW All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. END
BEGIN NOW Voglio END
BEGIN NOW e non. END
BEGIN NOW Like to give them an odd cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW Sociable. END
BEGIN NOW Shout a few flying END
BEGIN NOW syllables as they pass. END
BEGIN NOW He hummed: END
BEGIN NOW LÃ  ci darem la mano La la lala la la. END
BEGIN NOW He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the END
BEGIN NOW lee of the station wall. END
BEGIN NOW No-one. END
BEGIN NOW Meade's timberyard. END
BEGIN NOW Piled balks. END
BEGIN NOW Ruins END
BEGIN NOW and tenements. END
BEGIN NOW With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with END
BEGIN NOW its forgotten pickeystone. END
BEGIN NOW Not a sinner. END
BEGIN NOW Near the timberyard a squatted END
BEGIN NOW child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. END
BEGIN NOW A wise END
BEGIN NOW tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. END
BEGIN NOW Pity to disturb END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. END
BEGIN NOW Open it. END
BEGIN NOW And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's school. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW liked mignonette. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Ellis's. END
BEGIN NOW And Mr? END
BEGIN NOW He opened the letter within the END
BEGIN NOW newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW A flower. END
BEGIN NOW I think it's a. END
BEGIN NOW A yellow flower with flattened petals. END
BEGIN NOW Not END
BEGIN NOW annoyed then? END
BEGIN NOW What does she say? END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry END
BEGIN NOW I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry END
BEGIN NOW you did not like my last letter. END
BEGIN NOW Why did you enclose the stamps? END
BEGIN NOW I am END
BEGIN NOW awfully angry with you. END
BEGIN NOW I do wish I could punish you for that. END
BEGIN NOW I called END
BEGIN NOW you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. END
BEGIN NOW Please tell me END
BEGIN NOW what is the real meaning of that word? END
BEGIN NOW Are you not happy in your home END
BEGIN NOW you poor little naughty boy? END
BEGIN NOW I do wish I could do something for you. END
BEGIN NOW Please tell me what you think of poor me. END
BEGIN NOW I often think of the beautiful END
BEGIN NOW name you have. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry, when will we meet? END
BEGIN NOW I think of you so often END
BEGIN NOW you have no idea. END
BEGIN NOW I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as END
BEGIN NOW you. END
BEGIN NOW I feel so bad about. END
BEGIN NOW Please write me a long letter and tell me END
BEGIN NOW more. END
BEGIN NOW Remember if you do not I will punish you. END
BEGIN NOW So now you know what I END
BEGIN NOW will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. END
BEGIN NOW O how I long to END
BEGIN NOW meet you. END
BEGIN NOW Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are END
BEGIN NOW exhausted. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will tell you all. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye now, naughty darling, I END
BEGIN NOW have such a bad headache. END
BEGIN NOW today. END
BEGIN NOW and write by return to your longing END
BEGIN NOW Martha END
BEGIN NOW P. END
BEGIN NOW S. END
BEGIN NOW Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. END
BEGIN NOW I want to END
BEGIN NOW know. END
BEGIN NOW He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell END
BEGIN NOW and placed it in his heart pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Language of flowers. END
BEGIN NOW They like it END
BEGIN NOW because no-one can hear. END
BEGIN NOW Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. END
BEGIN NOW Then END
BEGIN NOW walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and END
BEGIN NOW there a word. END
BEGIN NOW Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus END
BEGIN NOW if you don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses END
BEGIN NOW when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his END
BEGIN NOW sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW Weak joy opened his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Changed since the first letter. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder did she END
BEGIN NOW wrote it herself. END
BEGIN NOW Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, END
BEGIN NOW respectable character. END
BEGIN NOW Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. END
BEGIN NOW Thank END
BEGIN NOW you: not having any. END
BEGIN NOW Usual love scrimmage. END
BEGIN NOW Then running round corners. END
BEGIN NOW Bad as a row with Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Cigar has a cooling effect. END
BEGIN NOW Narcotic. END
BEGIN NOW Go END
BEGIN NOW further next time. END
BEGIN NOW Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Brutal, why not? END
BEGIN NOW Try it anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW A bit at a time. END
BEGIN NOW Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Common pin, eh? END
BEGIN NOW He threw it on the road. END
BEGIN NOW Out of her clothes somewhere: END
BEGIN NOW pinned together. END
BEGIN NOW Queer the number of pins they always have. END
BEGIN NOW No roses END
BEGIN NOW without thorns. END
BEGIN NOW Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. END
BEGIN NOW Those two sluts that night in the END
BEGIN NOW Coombe, linked together in the rain. END
BEGIN NOW O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't know what to do To keep END
BEGIN NOW it up To keep it up. END
BEGIN NOW It? END
BEGIN NOW Them. END
BEGIN NOW Such a bad headache. END
BEGIN NOW Has her roses probably. END
BEGIN NOW Or sitting all END
BEGIN NOW day typing. END
BEGIN NOW Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. END
BEGIN NOW What perfume does your wife END
BEGIN NOW use. END
BEGIN NOW Now could you make out a thing like that? END
BEGIN NOW To keep it up. END
BEGIN NOW Martha, Mary. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or END
BEGIN NOW faked for money. END
BEGIN NOW He is sitting in their house, talking. END
BEGIN NOW Mysterious. END
BEGIN NOW Also END
BEGIN NOW the two sluts in the Coombe would listen. END
BEGIN NOW To keep it up. END
BEGIN NOW Nice kind of evening feeling. END
BEGIN NOW No more wandering about. END
BEGIN NOW Just loll there: END
BEGIN NOW quiet dusk: let everything rip. END
BEGIN NOW Forget. END
BEGIN NOW Tell about places you have been, END
BEGIN NOW strange customs. END
BEGIN NOW The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: END
BEGIN NOW fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole END
BEGIN NOW in the wall at Ashtown. END
BEGIN NOW Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the END
BEGIN NOW trottingmatches. END
BEGIN NOW She listens with big dark soft eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her: more and END
BEGIN NOW more: all. END
BEGIN NOW Then a sigh: silence. END
BEGIN NOW Long long long rest. END
BEGIN NOW Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly END
BEGIN NOW in shreds and scattered them towards the road. END
BEGIN NOW The shreds fluttered END
BEGIN NOW away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank. END
BEGIN NOW Henry Flower. END
BEGIN NOW You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the END
BEGIN NOW same way. END
BEGIN NOW Simple bit of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure END
BEGIN NOW cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Shows you the money to be END
BEGIN NOW made out of porter. END
BEGIN NOW Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change END
BEGIN NOW his shirt four times a day, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Skin breeds lice or vermin. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW million pounds, wait a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, END
BEGIN NOW eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. END
BEGIN NOW One and four into twenty: fifteen about. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen millions END
BEGIN NOW of barrels of porter. END
BEGIN NOW What am I saying barrels? END
BEGIN NOW Gallons. END
BEGIN NOW About a million barrels all the same. END
BEGIN NOW An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. END
BEGIN NOW Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing END
BEGIN NOW together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy END
BEGIN NOW pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth. END
BEGIN NOW He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. END
BEGIN NOW Stepping into the porch END
BEGIN NOW he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again END
BEGIN NOW behind the leather headband. END
BEGIN NOW Damn it. END
BEGIN NOW I might have tried to work M'Coy END
BEGIN NOW for a pass to Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Same notice on the door. END
BEGIN NOW Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.J. END
BEGIN NOW on END
BEGIN NOW saint Peter Claver S.J. END
BEGIN NOW and the African Mission. END
BEGIN NOW Prayers for the END
BEGIN NOW conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW protestants are the same. END
BEGIN NOW Convert Dr William J. END
BEGIN NOW Walsh D.D. END
BEGIN NOW to the true END
BEGIN NOW religion. END
BEGIN NOW Save China's millions. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how they explain it to the END
BEGIN NOW heathen Chinee. END
BEGIN NOW Prefer an ounce of opium. END
BEGIN NOW Celestials. END
BEGIN NOW Rank heresy for END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. END
BEGIN NOW Taking it easy END
BEGIN NOW with hand under his cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Josssticks burning. END
BEGIN NOW Not like Ecce Homo. END
BEGIN NOW Crown END
BEGIN NOW of thorns and cross. END
BEGIN NOW Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. END
BEGIN NOW Chopsticks? END
BEGIN NOW Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry I END
BEGIN NOW didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that END
BEGIN NOW Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW They're taught that. END
BEGIN NOW He's END
BEGIN NOW not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise END
BEGIN NOW blacks, is he? END
BEGIN NOW The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. END
BEGIN NOW Like to see END
BEGIN NOW them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. END
BEGIN NOW Still END
BEGIN NOW life. END
BEGIN NOW Lap it up like milk, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW The cold smell of sacred stone called him. END
BEGIN NOW He trod the worn steps, END
BEGIN NOW pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere. END
BEGIN NOW Something going on: some sodality. END
BEGIN NOW Pity so empty. END
BEGIN NOW Nice discreet place to END
BEGIN NOW be next some girl. END
BEGIN NOW Who is my neighbour? END
BEGIN NOW Jammed by the hour to slow END
BEGIN NOW music. END
BEGIN NOW That woman at midnight mass. END
BEGIN NOW Seventh heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Women knelt in the END
BEGIN NOW benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. END
BEGIN NOW A batch END
BEGIN NOW knelt at the altarrails. END
BEGIN NOW The priest went along by them, murmuring, END
BEGIN NOW holding the thing in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW He stopped at each, took out a END
BEGIN NOW communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it END
BEGIN NOW neatly into her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Her hat and head sank. END
BEGIN NOW Then the next one. END
BEGIN NOW Her hat END
BEGIN NOW sank at once. END
BEGIN NOW Then the next one: a small old woman. END
BEGIN NOW The priest bent down END
BEGIN NOW to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Latin. END
BEGIN NOW The next one. END
BEGIN NOW Shut your eyes and open your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Corpus: body. END
BEGIN NOW Corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW idea the Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Stupefies them first. END
BEGIN NOW Hospice for the dying. END
BEGIN NOW They don't END
BEGIN NOW seem to chew it: only swallow it down. END
BEGIN NOW Rum idea: eating bits of a END
BEGIN NOW corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Why the cannibals cotton to it. END
BEGIN NOW He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by END
BEGIN NOW one, and seek their places. END
BEGIN NOW He approached a bench and seated himself in END
BEGIN NOW its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW These pots we have to wear. END
BEGIN NOW We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. END
BEGIN NOW They were about him here END
BEGIN NOW and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for END
BEGIN NOW it to melt in their stomachs. END
BEGIN NOW Something like those mazzoth: it's that END
BEGIN NOW sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. END
BEGIN NOW Look at them. END
BEGIN NOW Now I bet it makes END
BEGIN NOW them feel happy. END
BEGIN NOW Lollipop. END
BEGIN NOW It does. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bread of angels it's called. END
BEGIN NOW There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. END
BEGIN NOW First communicants. END
BEGIN NOW Hokypoky penny a lump. END
BEGIN NOW Then feel all like one family END
BEGIN NOW party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. END
BEGIN NOW They do. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure of END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW Not so lonely. END
BEGIN NOW In our confraternity. END
BEGIN NOW Then come out a bit spreeish. END
BEGIN NOW Let off steam. END
BEGIN NOW Thing is if you really believe in it. END
BEGIN NOW Lourdes cure, END
BEGIN NOW waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. END
BEGIN NOW Old END
BEGIN NOW fellow asleep near that confessionbox. END
BEGIN NOW Hence those snores. END
BEGIN NOW Blind faith. END
BEGIN NOW Safe in the arms of kingdom come. END
BEGIN NOW Lulls all pain. END
BEGIN NOW Wake this time next END
BEGIN NOW year. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an END
BEGIN NOW instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace END
BEGIN NOW affair he had on. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he lost the pin of his. END
BEGIN NOW He wouldn't know what END
BEGIN NOW to do to. END
BEGIN NOW Bald spot behind. END
BEGIN NOW Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? END
BEGIN NOW No: I.H.S. END
BEGIN NOW Molly told me one time I asked her. END
BEGIN NOW I have sinned: or no: I have END
BEGIN NOW suffered, it is. END
BEGIN NOW And the other one? END
BEGIN NOW Iron nails ran in. END
BEGIN NOW Meet one Sunday after the rosary. END
BEGIN NOW Do not deny my request. END
BEGIN NOW Turn up with a END
BEGIN NOW veil and black bag. END
BEGIN NOW Dusk and the light behind her. END
BEGIN NOW She might be here END
BEGIN NOW with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the END
BEGIN NOW sly. END
BEGIN NOW Their character. END
BEGIN NOW That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the END
BEGIN NOW invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion END
BEGIN NOW every morning. END
BEGIN NOW This very church. END
BEGIN NOW Peter Carey, yes. END
BEGIN NOW No, Peter Claver I am END
BEGIN NOW thinking of. END
BEGIN NOW Denis Carey. END
BEGIN NOW And just imagine that. END
BEGIN NOW Wife and six children END
BEGIN NOW at home. END
BEGIN NOW And plotting that murder all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Those crawthumpers, now END
BEGIN NOW that's a good name for them, there's always something shiftylooking END
BEGIN NOW about them. END
BEGIN NOW They're not straight men of business either. END
BEGIN NOW O, no, she's END
BEGIN NOW not here: the flower: no, no. END
BEGIN NOW By the way, did I tear up that envelope? END
BEGIN NOW Yes: under the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs END
BEGIN NOW smartly. END
BEGIN NOW Wine. END
BEGIN NOW Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank END
BEGIN NOW what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage END
BEGIN NOW Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale END
BEGIN NOW (aromatic). END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other. END
BEGIN NOW Cold END
BEGIN NOW comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one old END
BEGIN NOW booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW Queer the END
BEGIN NOW whole atmosphere of the. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right. END
BEGIN NOW Perfectly right that is. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. END
BEGIN NOW Not going to be any music. END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW Who has the organ here I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW Old Glynn he knew how to make that END
BEGIN NOW instrument talk, the vibrato: fifty pounds a year they say he had in END
BEGIN NOW Gardiner street. END
BEGIN NOW Molly was in fine voice that day, the Stabat Mater of END
BEGIN NOW Rossini. END
BEGIN NOW Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. END
BEGIN NOW Christ or Pilate? END
BEGIN NOW Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. END
BEGIN NOW Music they wanted. END
BEGIN NOW Footdrill stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Could hear a pin drop. END
BEGIN NOW I told her to pitch her voice END
BEGIN NOW against that corner. END
BEGIN NOW I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the END
BEGIN NOW people looking up: END
BEGIN NOW Quis est homo. END
BEGIN NOW Some of that old sacred music splendid. END
BEGIN NOW Mercadante: seven last words. END
BEGIN NOW Mozart's twelfth mass: Gloria in that. END
BEGIN NOW Those old popes keen on music, on END
BEGIN NOW art and statues and pictures of all kinds. END
BEGIN NOW Palestrina for example too. END
BEGIN NOW They had a gay old time while it lasted. END
BEGIN NOW Healthy too, chanting, regular END
BEGIN NOW hours, then brew liqueurs. END
BEGIN NOW Benedictine. END
BEGIN NOW Green Chartreuse. END
BEGIN NOW Still, having END
BEGIN NOW eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of END
BEGIN NOW voice is it? END
BEGIN NOW Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses. END
BEGIN NOW Connoisseurs. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a END
BEGIN NOW placid. END
BEGIN NOW No worry. END
BEGIN NOW Fall into flesh, don't they? END
BEGIN NOW Gluttons, tall, long END
BEGIN NOW legs. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW Eunuch. END
BEGIN NOW One way out of it. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and END
BEGIN NOW bless all the people. END
BEGIN NOW All crossed themselves and stood up. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom END
BEGIN NOW glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. END
BEGIN NOW Stand END
BEGIN NOW up at the gospel of course. END
BEGIN NOW Then all settled down on their knees again END
BEGIN NOW and he sat back quietly in his bench. END
BEGIN NOW The priest came down from the END
BEGIN NOW altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered END
BEGIN NOW each other in Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a END
BEGIN NOW card: END
BEGIN NOW —O God, our refuge and our strength... END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. END
BEGIN NOW English. END
BEGIN NOW Throw them END
BEGIN NOW the bone. END
BEGIN NOW I remember slightly. END
BEGIN NOW How long since your last mass? END
BEGIN NOW Glorious END
BEGIN NOW and immaculate virgin. END
BEGIN NOW Joseph, her spouse. END
BEGIN NOW Peter and Paul. END
BEGIN NOW More END
BEGIN NOW interesting if you understood what it was all about. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful END
BEGIN NOW organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. END
BEGIN NOW Confession. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone wants END
BEGIN NOW to. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will tell you all. END
BEGIN NOW Penance. END
BEGIN NOW Punish me, please. END
BEGIN NOW Great weapon END
BEGIN NOW in their hands. END
BEGIN NOW More than doctor or solicitor. END
BEGIN NOW Woman dying to. END
BEGIN NOW And I END
BEGIN NOW schschschschschsch. END
BEGIN NOW And did you chachachachacha? END
BEGIN NOW And why did you? END
BEGIN NOW Look END
BEGIN NOW down at her ring to find an excuse. END
BEGIN NOW Whispering gallery walls have ears. END
BEGIN NOW Husband learn to his surprise. END
BEGIN NOW God's little joke. END
BEGIN NOW Then out she comes. END
BEGIN NOW Repentance skindeep. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely shame. END
BEGIN NOW Pray at an altar. END
BEGIN NOW Hail Mary and Holy END
BEGIN NOW Mary. END
BEGIN NOW Flowers, incense, candles melting. END
BEGIN NOW Hide her blushes. END
BEGIN NOW Salvation END
BEGIN NOW army blatant imitation. END
BEGIN NOW Reformed prostitute will address the meeting. END
BEGIN NOW How I found the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they END
BEGIN NOW work the whole show. END
BEGIN NOW And don't they rake in the money too? END
BEGIN NOW Bequests END
BEGIN NOW also: to the P.P. END
BEGIN NOW for the time being in his absolute discretion. END
BEGIN NOW Masses END
BEGIN NOW for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors. END
BEGIN NOW Monasteries and convents. END
BEGIN NOW The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the END
BEGIN NOW witnessbox. END
BEGIN NOW No browbeating him. END
BEGIN NOW He had his answer pat for everything. END
BEGIN NOW Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. END
BEGIN NOW The doctors of the END
BEGIN NOW church: they mapped out the whole theology of it. END
BEGIN NOW The priest prayed: END
BEGIN NOW —Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. END
BEGIN NOW Be our END
BEGIN NOW safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God END
BEGIN NOW restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly END
BEGIN NOW host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those END
BEGIN NOW other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. END
BEGIN NOW The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. END
BEGIN NOW All over. END
BEGIN NOW The women END
BEGIN NOW remained behind: thanksgiving. END
BEGIN NOW Better be shoving along. END
BEGIN NOW Brother Buzz. END
BEGIN NOW Come around with the plate END
BEGIN NOW perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Pay your Easter duty. END
BEGIN NOW He stood up. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the END
BEGIN NOW time? END
BEGIN NOW Women enjoy it. END
BEGIN NOW Never tell you. END
BEGIN NOW But we. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse, miss, there's a END
BEGIN NOW (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. END
BEGIN NOW Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. END
BEGIN NOW Glimpses of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW Annoyed if you don't. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you tell me END
BEGIN NOW before. END
BEGIN NOW Still like you better untidy. END
BEGIN NOW Good job it wasn't farther south. END
BEGIN NOW He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main END
BEGIN NOW door into the light. END
BEGIN NOW He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble END
BEGIN NOW bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in END
BEGIN NOW the low tide of holy water. END
BEGIN NOW Trams: a car of Prescott's dyeworks: a widow END
BEGIN NOW in her weeds. END
BEGIN NOW Notice because I'm in mourning myself. END
BEGIN NOW He covered himself. END
BEGIN NOW How goes the time? END
BEGIN NOW Quarter past. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough yet. END
BEGIN NOW Better get that lotion END
BEGIN NOW made up. END
BEGIN NOW Where is this? END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes, the last time. END
BEGIN NOW Sweny's in Lincoln place. END
BEGIN NOW Chemists rarely move. END
BEGIN NOW Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir. END
BEGIN NOW Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of the flood. END
BEGIN NOW Huguenot churchyard END
BEGIN NOW near there. END
BEGIN NOW Visit some day. END
BEGIN NOW He walked southward along Westland row. END
BEGIN NOW But the recipe is in the other END
BEGIN NOW trousers. END
BEGIN NOW O, and I forgot that latchkey too. END
BEGIN NOW Bore this funeral affair. END
BEGIN NOW O END
BEGIN NOW well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. END
BEGIN NOW When was it I got it made up END
BEGIN NOW last? END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I changed a sovereign I remember. END
BEGIN NOW First of the month it must END
BEGIN NOW have been or the second. END
BEGIN NOW O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book. END
BEGIN NOW The chemist turned back page after page. END
BEGIN NOW Sandy shrivelled smell he seems END
BEGIN NOW to have. END
BEGIN NOW Shrunken skull. END

BEGIN NOW —About a fortnight ago, sir? END

BEGIN NOW He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the END

BEGIN NOW Lot of time taken up telling END
BEGIN NOW your aches and pains. END
BEGIN NOW —Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then END
BEGIN NOW orangeflower water... END
BEGIN NOW It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax. END
BEGIN NOW —And white wax also, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Brings out the darkness of her eyes. END

BEGIN NOW Have you brought a END

BEGIN NOW —No, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Make it up, please. END
BEGIN NOW I'll call later in the day and END
BEGIN NOW I'll take one of these soaps. END
BEGIN NOW How much are they? END
BEGIN NOW —Fourpence, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet lemony wax. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll take this one, he said. END
BEGIN NOW That makes three and a penny. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, the chemist said. END
BEGIN NOW You can pay all together, sir, when you END

BEGIN NOW —Good, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the END

BEGIN NOW At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said: END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW Is that today's? END
BEGIN NOW Show us a minute. END
BEGIN NOW Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! END
BEGIN NOW Long cold upper lip. END
BEGIN NOW To look END

BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. END
BEGIN NOW Wants a END

BEGIN NOW Take off the rough dirt. END
BEGIN NOW Good morning, have you used Pears' END
BEGIN NOW soap? END
BEGIN NOW Dandruff on his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Scalp wants oiling. END
BEGIN NOW —I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam END
BEGIN NOW Lyons said. END
BEGIN NOW Where the bugger is it? END
BEGIN NOW He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar. END
BEGIN NOW Barber's itch. END
BEGIN NOW Tight collar he'll lose his hair. END
BEGIN NOW Better leave him the END
BEGIN NOW paper and get shut of him. END
BEGIN NOW —You can keep it, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW —Ascot. END
BEGIN NOW Gold cup. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. END
BEGIN NOW Half a mo. END
BEGIN NOW Maximum the END
BEGIN NOW second. END
BEGIN NOW —I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW his sharp voice said. END
BEGIN NOW —I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW I was going to throw it away END
BEGIN NOW that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread END
BEGIN NOW sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll risk it, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Here, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW He sped off towards Conway's corner. END
BEGIN NOW God speed scut. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in END
BEGIN NOW it, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Silly lips of that chap. END
BEGIN NOW Betting. END
BEGIN NOW Regular hotbed of it END
BEGIN NOW lately. END
BEGIN NOW Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. END

BEGIN NOW Your Christmas dinner for threepence. END
BEGIN NOW Jack Fleming END
BEGIN NOW embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. END
BEGIN NOW Keeps a hotel now. END
BEGIN NOW They never come back. END
BEGIN NOW Fleshpots of Egypt. END
BEGIN NOW He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. END
BEGIN NOW Remind you of a END
BEGIN NOW mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. END
BEGIN NOW College sports today I see. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled END
BEGIN NOW up like a cod in a pot. END
BEGIN NOW Damn bad ad. END
BEGIN NOW Now if they had made it round like END
BEGIN NOW a wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: END
BEGIN NOW college. END
BEGIN NOW Something to catch the eye. END
BEGIN NOW There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. END
BEGIN NOW Keep him on hands: END
BEGIN NOW might take a turn in there on the nod. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do, Mr Hornblower? END
BEGIN NOW How END
BEGIN NOW do you do, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Heavenly weather really. END
BEGIN NOW If life was always like that. END
BEGIN NOW Cricket weather. END
BEGIN NOW Sit around under sunshades. END
BEGIN NOW Over after over. END
BEGIN NOW Out. END
BEGIN NOW They can't play it END
BEGIN NOW here. END
BEGIN NOW Duck for six wickets. END
BEGIN NOW Still Captain Culler broke a window in the END
BEGIN NOW Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. END
BEGIN NOW Donnybrook fair more in END
BEGIN NOW their line. END
BEGIN NOW And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the END
BEGIN NOW floor. END
BEGIN NOW Heatwave. END
BEGIN NOW Won't last. END
BEGIN NOW Always passing, the stream of life, which END
BEGIN NOW in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all. END
BEGIN NOW Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid END
BEGIN NOW stream. END
BEGIN NOW This is my body. END
BEGIN NOW He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of END
BEGIN NOW warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. END
BEGIN NOW He saw his trunk END
BEGIN NOW and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, END
BEGIN NOW lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of END
BEGIN NOW his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of END
BEGIN NOW thousands, a languid floating flower. END
BEGIN NOW [ 6 ] END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking END
BEGIN NOW carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power stepped in after END
BEGIN NOW him, curving his height with care. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on, Simon. END
BEGIN NOW —After you, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW —Are we all here now? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked. END
BEGIN NOW Come along, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled the door to END
BEGIN NOW after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. END
BEGIN NOW He passed an arm END
BEGIN NOW through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow END
BEGIN NOW at the lowered blinds of the avenue. END
BEGIN NOW One dragged aside: an old woman END
BEGIN NOW peeping. END
BEGIN NOW Nose whiteflattened against the pane. END
BEGIN NOW Thanking her stars she END
BEGIN NOW was passed over. END
BEGIN NOW Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Glad END
BEGIN NOW to see us go we give them such trouble coming. END
BEGIN NOW Job seems to suit them. END
BEGIN NOW Huggermugger in corners. END
BEGIN NOW Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd END
BEGIN NOW wake. END
BEGIN NOW Then getting it ready. END
BEGIN NOW Laying it out. END
BEGIN NOW Molly and Mrs Fleming making END
BEGIN NOW the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Pull it more to your side. END
BEGIN NOW Our windingsheet. END
BEGIN NOW Never know who END
BEGIN NOW will touch you dead. END
BEGIN NOW Wash and shampoo. END
BEGIN NOW I believe they clip the nails and END
BEGIN NOW the hair. END
BEGIN NOW Keep a bit in an envelope. END
BEGIN NOW Grows all the same after. END
BEGIN NOW Unclean END
BEGIN NOW job. END
BEGIN NOW All waited. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing was said. END
BEGIN NOW Stowing in the wreaths probably. END
BEGIN NOW I am END
BEGIN NOW sitting on something hard. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Better shift END
BEGIN NOW it out of that. END
BEGIN NOW Wait for an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW All waited. END
BEGIN NOW Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: END
BEGIN NOW then horses' hoofs. END
BEGIN NOW A jolt. END
BEGIN NOW Their carriage began to move, creaking and END
BEGIN NOW swaying. END
BEGIN NOW Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. END
BEGIN NOW The blinds of END
BEGIN NOW the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. END
BEGIN NOW At END
BEGIN NOW walking pace. END
BEGIN NOW They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were END
BEGIN NOW passing along the tramtracks. END
BEGIN NOW Tritonville road. END
BEGIN NOW Quicker. END
BEGIN NOW The wheels END
BEGIN NOW rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook END
BEGIN NOW rattling in the doorframes. END
BEGIN NOW —What way is he taking us? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked through both windows. END
BEGIN NOW —Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Ringsend. END
BEGIN NOW Brunswick street. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out. END
BEGIN NOW —That's a fine old custom, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad to see it has not died END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by END
BEGIN NOW passers. END
BEGIN NOW Respect. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the END
BEGIN NOW smoother road past Watery lane. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, END
BEGIN NOW clad in mourning, a wide hat. END
BEGIN NOW —There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Who is that? END
BEGIN NOW —Your son and heir. END
BEGIN NOW —Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway END
BEGIN NOW before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back END
BEGIN NOW to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus END
BEGIN NOW fell back, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —Was that Mulligan cad with him? END
BEGIN NOW His fidus Achates! END
BEGIN NOW —No, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He was alone. END
BEGIN NOW —Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding END
BEGIN NOW faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump END
BEGIN NOW of dung, the wise child that knows her own father. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. END
BEGIN NOW Wallace Bros: the END
BEGIN NOW bottleworks: Dodder bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Richie Goulding and the legal bag. END
BEGIN NOW Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls END
BEGIN NOW the firm. END
BEGIN NOW His jokes are getting a bit damp. END
BEGIN NOW Great card he was. END
BEGIN NOW Waltzing END
BEGIN NOW in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the END
BEGIN NOW landlady's two hats pinned on his head. END
BEGIN NOW Out on the rampage all night. END
BEGIN NOW Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. END
BEGIN NOW Wife ironing END
BEGIN NOW his back. END
BEGIN NOW Thinks he'll cure it with pills. END
BEGIN NOW All breadcrumbs they are. END
BEGIN NOW About six hundred per cent profit. END
BEGIN NOW —He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. END
BEGIN NOW That Mulligan is a END
BEGIN NOW contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. END
BEGIN NOW His name stinks END
BEGIN NOW all over Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll END
BEGIN NOW make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or END
BEGIN NOW his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me. END
BEGIN NOW He cried above the clatter of the wheels: END
BEGIN NOW —I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. END
BEGIN NOW A counterjumper's END
BEGIN NOW son. END
BEGIN NOW Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. END
BEGIN NOW Not likely. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild END
BEGIN NOW face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. END
BEGIN NOW Noisy END
BEGIN NOW selfwilled man. END
BEGIN NOW Full of his son. END
BEGIN NOW He is right. END
BEGIN NOW Something to hand on. END
BEGIN NOW If END
BEGIN NOW little Rudy had lived. END
BEGIN NOW See him grow up. END
BEGIN NOW Hear his voice in the house. END
BEGIN NOW Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. END
BEGIN NOW My son. END
BEGIN NOW Me in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Strange END
BEGIN NOW feeling it would be. END
BEGIN NOW From me. END
BEGIN NOW Just a chance. END
BEGIN NOW Must have been that morning END
BEGIN NOW in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by END
BEGIN NOW the wall of the cease to do evil. END
BEGIN NOW And the sergeant grinning up. END
BEGIN NOW She had END
BEGIN NOW that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. END
BEGIN NOW Give us a touch, END
BEGIN NOW Poldy. END
BEGIN NOW God, I'm dying for it. END
BEGIN NOW How life begins. END
BEGIN NOW Got big then. END
BEGIN NOW Had to refuse the Greystones concert. END
BEGIN NOW My son inside her. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW could have helped him on in life. END
BEGIN NOW I could. END
BEGIN NOW Make him independent. END
BEGIN NOW Learn END
BEGIN NOW German too. END
BEGIN NOW —Are we late? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch. END
BEGIN NOW Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Milly. END
BEGIN NOW Same thing watered down. END
BEGIN NOW Her tomboy oaths. END
BEGIN NOW O jumping END
BEGIN NOW Jupiter! END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods and little fishes! END
BEGIN NOW Still, she's a dear girl. END
BEGIN NOW Soon be a END
BEGIN NOW woman. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Papli. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes: a woman too. END
BEGIN NOW Life, life. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying. END
BEGIN NOW —Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. END
BEGIN NOW Do END
BEGIN NOW you follow me? END
BEGIN NOW He closed his left eye. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham began to brush away END
BEGIN NOW crustcrumbs from under his thighs. END
BEGIN NOW —What is this, he said, in the name of God? END
BEGIN NOW Crumbs? END
BEGIN NOW —Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power END
BEGIN NOW said. END
BEGIN NOW All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless END
BEGIN NOW leather of the seats. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward END
BEGIN NOW and said: END
BEGIN NOW —Unless I'm greatly mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think, Martin? END
BEGIN NOW —It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom set his thigh down. END
BEGIN NOW Glad I took that bath. END
BEGIN NOW Feel my feet quite END
BEGIN NOW clean. END
BEGIN NOW But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly. END
BEGIN NOW —After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW —Did Tom Kernan turn up? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of END
BEGIN NOW his beard gently. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom answered. END
BEGIN NOW He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. END
BEGIN NOW —And Corny Kelleher himself? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW —At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW —I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He said he'd try to come. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage halted short. END
BEGIN NOW —What's wrong? END
BEGIN NOW —We're stopped. END
BEGIN NOW —Where are we? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom put his head out of the window. END
BEGIN NOW —The grand canal, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Gasworks. END
BEGIN NOW Whooping cough they say it cures. END
BEGIN NOW Good job Milly never got it. END
BEGIN NOW Poor children! END
BEGIN NOW Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. END
BEGIN NOW Shame END
BEGIN NOW really. END
BEGIN NOW Got off lightly with illnesses compared. END
BEGIN NOW Only measles. END
BEGIN NOW Flaxseed END
BEGIN NOW tea. END
BEGIN NOW Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. END
BEGIN NOW Canvassing for death. END
BEGIN NOW Don't miss END
BEGIN NOW this chance. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs' home over there. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old Athos! END
BEGIN NOW Be good to Athos, END
BEGIN NOW Leopold, is my last wish. END
BEGIN NOW Thy will be done. END
BEGIN NOW We obey them in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW dying scrawl. END
BEGIN NOW He took it to heart, pined away. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet brute. END
BEGIN NOW Old men's END
BEGIN NOW dogs usually are. END
BEGIN NOW A raindrop spat on his hat. END
BEGIN NOW He drew back and saw an instant of shower END
BEGIN NOW spray dots over the grey flags. END
BEGIN NOW Apart. END
BEGIN NOW Curious. END
BEGIN NOW Like through a colander. END
BEGIN NOW I thought it would. END
BEGIN NOW My boots were creaking I remember now. END
BEGIN NOW —The weather is changing, he said quietly. END
BEGIN NOW —A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW —Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW There's the sun again coming END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a END
BEGIN NOW mute curse at the sky. END
BEGIN NOW —It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —We're off again. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed END
BEGIN NOW gently. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. END
BEGIN NOW —Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. END
BEGIN NOW And Paddy Leonard taking END
BEGIN NOW him off to his face. END
BEGIN NOW —O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till you hear him, END
BEGIN NOW Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of The Croppy Boy. END
BEGIN NOW —Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. END
BEGIN NOW His singing of that simple END
BEGIN NOW ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the END
BEGIN NOW whole course of my experience. END
BEGIN NOW —Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead nuts on that. END
BEGIN NOW And the END
BEGIN NOW retrospective arrangement. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is it? END
BEGIN NOW —In the paper this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. END
BEGIN NOW That book I must change END
BEGIN NOW for her. END
BEGIN NOW —No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Later on please. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the END
BEGIN NOW deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what END
BEGIN NOW Peake is that? END
BEGIN NOW is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? END
BEGIN NOW no, Sexton, END
BEGIN NOW Urbright. END
BEGIN NOW Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks to the Little Flower. END
BEGIN NOW Sadly missed. END
BEGIN NOW To the inexpressible grief of END
BEGIN NOW his. END
BEGIN NOW Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. END
BEGIN NOW Month's mind: Quinlan. END
BEGIN NOW On END
BEGIN NOW whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy. END
BEGIN NOW It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky END
BEGIN NOW While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him END
BEGIN NOW on high. END
BEGIN NOW I tore up the envelope? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I put her letter after I read it END
BEGIN NOW in the bath? END
BEGIN NOW He patted his waistcoatpocket. END
BEGIN NOW There all right. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Henry END
BEGIN NOW fled. END
BEGIN NOW Before my patience are exhausted. END
BEGIN NOW National school. END
BEGIN NOW Meade's yard. END
BEGIN NOW The hazard. END
BEGIN NOW Only two there now. END
BEGIN NOW Nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Full as a tick. END
BEGIN NOW Too much bone in their skulls. END
BEGIN NOW The other trotting round END
BEGIN NOW with a fare. END
BEGIN NOW An hour ago I was passing there. END
BEGIN NOW The jarvies raised their END
BEGIN NOW hats. END
BEGIN NOW A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a END
BEGIN NOW tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't they invent something END
BEGIN NOW automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? END
BEGIN NOW Well but that fellow END
BEGIN NOW would lose his job then? END
BEGIN NOW Well but then another fellow would get a job END
BEGIN NOW making the new invention? END
BEGIN NOW Antient concert rooms. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing on there. END
BEGIN NOW A man in a buff suit with a END
BEGIN NOW crape armlet. END
BEGIN NOW Not much grief there. END
BEGIN NOW Quarter mourning. END
BEGIN NOW People in law END
BEGIN NOW perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway END
BEGIN NOW bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Hoardings: Eugene END
BEGIN NOW Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. END
BEGIN NOW I said I. END
BEGIN NOW Or the Lily of Killarney? END
BEGIN NOW Elster Grimes Opera Company. END
BEGIN NOW Big END
BEGIN NOW powerful change. END
BEGIN NOW Wet bright bills for next week. END
BEGIN NOW Fun on the Bristol. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW Have to stand a END
BEGIN NOW drink or two. END
BEGIN NOW As broad as it's long. END
BEGIN NOW He's coming in the afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Her songs. END
BEGIN NOW Plasto's. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. END
BEGIN NOW Who was he? END
BEGIN NOW —How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in END
BEGIN NOW salute. END
BEGIN NOW —He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he does. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW There he is airing his quiff. END
BEGIN NOW Just that moment I was thinking. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. END
BEGIN NOW From the door of the Red Bank the END
BEGIN NOW white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right END
BEGIN NOW hand. END
BEGIN NOW The nails, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Is there anything more in him that they she sees? END
BEGIN NOW Fascination. END
BEGIN NOW Worst man in Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW That keeps him alive. END
BEGIN NOW They sometimes END
BEGIN NOW feel what a person is. END
BEGIN NOW Instinct. END
BEGIN NOW But a type like that. END
BEGIN NOW My nails. END
BEGIN NOW I am END
BEGIN NOW just looking at them: well pared. END
BEGIN NOW And after: thinking alone. END
BEGIN NOW Body END
BEGIN NOW getting a bit softy. END
BEGIN NOW I would notice that: from remembering. END
BEGIN NOW What causes END
BEGIN NOW that? END
BEGIN NOW I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh END
BEGIN NOW falls off. END
BEGIN NOW But the shape is there. END
BEGIN NOW The shape is there still. END
BEGIN NOW Shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Hips. END
BEGIN NOW Plump. END
BEGIN NOW Night of the dance dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Shift stuck between the cheeks END
BEGIN NOW behind. END
BEGIN NOW He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant END
BEGIN NOW glance over their faces. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked: END
BEGIN NOW —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW —O, very well, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW I hear great accounts of it. END
BEGIN NOW It's a good END
BEGIN NOW idea, you see... END
BEGIN NOW —Are you going yourself? END
BEGIN NOW —Well no, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW In point of fact I have to go down to the END
BEGIN NOW county Clare on some private business. END
BEGIN NOW You see the idea is to tour the END
BEGIN NOW chief towns. END
BEGIN NOW What you lose on one you can make up on the other. END
BEGIN NOW —Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mary Anderson is up there now. END
BEGIN NOW Have you good artists? END
BEGIN NOW —Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW O yes, we'll have all END
BEGIN NOW topnobbers. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. END
BEGIN NOW The best, in END
BEGIN NOW fact. END
BEGIN NOW —And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Last but not least. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW Smith O'Brien. END
BEGIN NOW Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. END
BEGIN NOW Woman. END
BEGIN NOW Must be his deathday. END
BEGIN NOW For many happy returns. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage wheeling by END
BEGIN NOW Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees. END
BEGIN NOW Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his END
BEGIN NOW mouth opening: oot. END
BEGIN NOW —Four bootlaces for a penny. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. END
BEGIN NOW Had his office in Hume street. END
BEGIN NOW Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. END
BEGIN NOW Has that silk hat ever since. END
BEGIN NOW Relics of old decency. END
BEGIN NOW Mourning too. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible comedown, poor wretch! END
BEGIN NOW Kicked about like snuff at a wake. END
BEGIN NOW O'Callaghan on his last legs. END
BEGIN NOW And Madame. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty past eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Up. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Fleming is in to clean. END
BEGIN NOW Doing END
BEGIN NOW her hair, humming. END
BEGIN NOW voglio e non vorrei. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW vorrei e non. END
BEGIN NOW Looking at the END
BEGIN NOW tips of her hairs to see if they are split. END
BEGIN NOW Mi trema un poco il. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. END
BEGIN NOW A thrush. END
BEGIN NOW A throstle. END
BEGIN NOW There is a word throstle that expresses that. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. END
BEGIN NOW Greyish over END
BEGIN NOW the ears. END
BEGIN NOW Madame: smiling. END
BEGIN NOW I smiled back. END
BEGIN NOW A smile goes a long way. END
BEGIN NOW Only END
BEGIN NOW politeness perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Nice fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows is that true about the woman END
BEGIN NOW he keeps? END
BEGIN NOW Not pleasant for the wife. END
BEGIN NOW Yet they say, who was it told me, END
BEGIN NOW there is no carnal. END
BEGIN NOW You would imagine that would get played out pretty END
BEGIN NOW quick. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of END
BEGIN NOW rumpsteak. END
BEGIN NOW What is this she was? END
BEGIN NOW Barmaid in Jury's. END
BEGIN NOW Or the Moira, was END
BEGIN NOW it? END
BEGIN NOW They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power. END
BEGIN NOW —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner END
BEGIN NOW of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine. END
BEGIN NOW —In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: END
BEGIN NOW —The devil break the hasp of your back! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the END
BEGIN NOW carriage passed Gray's statue. END
BEGIN NOW —We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He caressed his beard, adding: END
BEGIN NOW —Well, nearly all of us. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces. END
BEGIN NOW —That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and END
BEGIN NOW the son. END
BEGIN NOW —About the boatman? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it awfully good? END
BEGIN NOW —What is that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't hear it. END
BEGIN NOW —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send END
BEGIN NOW him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ... END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW They were both on the way to the boat and he tried END
BEGIN NOW to drown... END
BEGIN NOW —Drown Barabbas! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus cried. END
BEGIN NOW I wish to Christ he did! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils. END
BEGIN NOW —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself... END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: END
BEGIN NOW —Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their END
BEGIN NOW way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose END
BEGIN NOW and over the wall with him into the Liffey. END
BEGIN NOW —For God's sake! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. END
BEGIN NOW Is he dead? END
BEGIN NOW —Dead! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham cried. END
BEGIN NOW Not he! END
BEGIN NOW A boatman got a pole and fished END
BEGIN NOW him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father END
BEGIN NOW on the quay more dead than alive. END
BEGIN NOW Half the town was there. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW But the funny part is... END
BEGIN NOW —And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for END
BEGIN NOW saving his son's life. END
BEGIN NOW A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand. END
BEGIN NOW —O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW Like a hero. END
BEGIN NOW A silver florin. END
BEGIN NOW —Isn't it awfully good? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW —One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage. END
BEGIN NOW Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW —Eight plums a penny! END
BEGIN NOW Eight for a penny! END
BEGIN NOW —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus sighed. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Many a good one he told himself. END
BEGIN NOW —The Lord forgive me! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his END
BEGIN NOW fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Paddy! END
BEGIN NOW I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and END
BEGIN NOW he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. END
BEGIN NOW He's END
BEGIN NOW gone from us. END
BEGIN NOW —As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW He went END
BEGIN NOW very suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW —Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Heart. END
BEGIN NOW He tapped his chest sadly. END
BEGIN NOW Blazing face: redhot. END
BEGIN NOW Too much John Barleycorn. END
BEGIN NOW Cure for a red nose. END
BEGIN NOW Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of money he spent END
BEGIN NOW colouring it. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension. END
BEGIN NOW —He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —The best death, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Their wide open eyes looked at him. END
BEGIN NOW —No suffering, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A moment and all is over. END
BEGIN NOW Like dying in sleep. END
BEGIN NOW No-one spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Dead side of the street this. END
BEGIN NOW Dull business by day, land agents, END
BEGIN NOW temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, END
BEGIN NOW Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Some reason. END
BEGIN NOW Sun or END
BEGIN NOW wind. END
BEGIN NOW At night too. END
BEGIN NOW Chummies and slaveys. END
BEGIN NOW Under the patronage of the END
BEGIN NOW late Father Mathew. END
BEGIN NOW Foundation stone for Parnell. END
BEGIN NOW Breakdown. END
BEGIN NOW Heart. END
BEGIN NOW White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, END
BEGIN NOW galloping. END
BEGIN NOW A tiny coffin flashed by. END
BEGIN NOW In a hurry to bury. END
BEGIN NOW A mourning END
BEGIN NOW coach. END
BEGIN NOW Unmarried. END
BEGIN NOW Black for the married. END
BEGIN NOW Piebald for bachelors. END
BEGIN NOW Dun for END
BEGIN NOW a nun. END
BEGIN NOW —Sad, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW A child. END
BEGIN NOW A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. END
BEGIN NOW Dwarf's body, END
BEGIN NOW weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. END
BEGIN NOW Burial friendly society pays. END
BEGIN NOW Penny a week for a sod of turf. END
BEGIN NOW Our. END
BEGIN NOW Little. END
BEGIN NOW Beggar. END
BEGIN NOW Baby. END
BEGIN NOW Meant END
BEGIN NOW nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Mistake of nature. END
BEGIN NOW If it's healthy it's from the mother. END
BEGIN NOW If not END
BEGIN NOW from the man. END
BEGIN NOW Better luck next time. END
BEGIN NOW —Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW It's well out of it. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. END
BEGIN NOW Rattle his END
BEGIN NOW bones. END
BEGIN NOW Over the stones. END
BEGIN NOW Only a pauper. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody owns. END
BEGIN NOW —In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW —But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back. END
BEGIN NOW —The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added. END
BEGIN NOW —Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW must take a charitable view of it. END
BEGIN NOW —They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW —It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham's END
BEGIN NOW large eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Looking away now. END
BEGIN NOW Sympathetic human man he is. END
BEGIN NOW Intelligent. END
BEGIN NOW Like Shakespeare's face. END
BEGIN NOW Always a good word to say. END
BEGIN NOW They have no mercy END
BEGIN NOW on that here or infanticide. END
BEGIN NOW Refuse christian burial. END
BEGIN NOW They used to drive END
BEGIN NOW a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW As if it wasn't broken END
BEGIN NOW already. END
BEGIN NOW Yet sometimes they repent too late. END
BEGIN NOW Found in the riverbed END
BEGIN NOW clutching rushes. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at me. END
BEGIN NOW And that awful drunkard of a wife of END
BEGIN NOW his. END
BEGIN NOW Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the END
BEGIN NOW furniture on him every Saturday almost. END
BEGIN NOW Leading him the life of the END
BEGIN NOW damned. END
BEGIN NOW Wear the heart out of a stone, that. END
BEGIN NOW Monday morning. END
BEGIN NOW Start END
BEGIN NOW afresh. END
BEGIN NOW Shoulder to the wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, she must have looked a sight that END
BEGIN NOW night Dedalus told me he was in there. END
BEGIN NOW Drunk about the place and END
BEGIN NOW capering with Martin's umbrella. END
BEGIN NOW And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The Geisha. END
BEGIN NOW He looked away from me. END
BEGIN NOW He knows. END
BEGIN NOW Rattle his bones. END
BEGIN NOW That afternoon of the inquest. END
BEGIN NOW The redlabelled bottle on the table. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW room in the hotel with hunting pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffy it was. END
BEGIN NOW Sunlight through END
BEGIN NOW the slats of the Venetian blind. END
BEGIN NOW The coroner's sunlit ears, big and END
BEGIN NOW hairy. END
BEGIN NOW Boots giving evidence. END
BEGIN NOW Thought he was asleep first. END
BEGIN NOW Then saw like END
BEGIN NOW yellow streaks on his face. END
BEGIN NOW Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Verdict: overdose. END
BEGIN NOW Death by misadventure. END
BEGIN NOW The letter. END
BEGIN NOW For my son END
BEGIN NOW Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW No more pain. END
BEGIN NOW Wake no more. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody owns. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. END
BEGIN NOW Over the stones. END
BEGIN NOW —We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW —God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW That will be a great race tomorrow END
BEGIN NOW in Germany. END
BEGIN NOW The Gordon Bennett. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW That will be worth seeing, faith. END
BEGIN NOW As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent END
BEGIN NOW over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. END
BEGIN NOW Has anybody END
BEGIN NOW here seen Kelly? END
BEGIN NOW Kay ee double ell wy. END
BEGIN NOW Dead March from Saul. END
BEGIN NOW He's as bad END
BEGIN NOW as old Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW He left me on my ownio. END
BEGIN NOW Pirouette! END
BEGIN NOW The Mater END
BEGIN NOW Misericordiae. END
BEGIN NOW Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW My house down there. END
BEGIN NOW Big place. END
BEGIN NOW Ward for END
BEGIN NOW incurables there. END
BEGIN NOW Very encouraging. END
BEGIN NOW Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. END
BEGIN NOW Deadhouse handy underneath. END
BEGIN NOW Where old Mrs Riordan died. END
BEGIN NOW They look END
BEGIN NOW terrible the women. END
BEGIN NOW Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the END
BEGIN NOW spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Then the screen round her bed for her to die. END
BEGIN NOW Nice young student END
BEGIN NOW that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone over to the lying- END
BEGIN NOW in hospital they told me. END
BEGIN NOW From one extreme to the other. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage END
BEGIN NOW galloped round a corner: stopped. END
BEGIN NOW —What's wrong now? END
BEGIN NOW A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching END
BEGIN NOW by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony END
BEGIN NOW croups. END
BEGIN NOW Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their END
BEGIN NOW fear. END
BEGIN NOW —Emigrants, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —Huuuh! END
BEGIN NOW the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks. END
BEGIN NOW Huuuh! END
BEGIN NOW out of that! END
BEGIN NOW Thursday, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow is killing day. END
BEGIN NOW Springers. END
BEGIN NOW Cuffe sold them END
BEGIN NOW about twentyseven quid each. END
BEGIN NOW For Liverpool probably. END
BEGIN NOW Roastbeef for old END
BEGIN NOW England. END
BEGIN NOW They buy up all the juicy ones. END
BEGIN NOW And then the fifth quarter END
BEGIN NOW lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. END
BEGIN NOW Comes to a big thing in a END
BEGIN NOW year. END
BEGIN NOW Dead meat trade. END
BEGIN NOW Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, END
BEGIN NOW soap, margarine. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off END
BEGIN NOW the train at Clonsilla. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage moved on through the drove. END
BEGIN NOW —I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the END
BEGIN NOW parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW All those animals could be taken END
BEGIN NOW in trucks down to the boats. END
BEGIN NOW —Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Quite END
BEGIN NOW right. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have END
BEGIN NOW municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Run the line END
BEGIN NOW out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage END
BEGIN NOW and all. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you see what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW —O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Pullman car and saloon END
BEGIN NOW diningroom. END
BEGIN NOW —A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added. END
BEGIN NOW —Why? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't it be more decent END
BEGIN NOW than galloping two abreast? END
BEGIN NOW —Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted. END
BEGIN NOW —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when the END
BEGIN NOW hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road. END
BEGIN NOW —That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell END
BEGIN NOW about the road. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible! END
BEGIN NOW —First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Gordon Bennett cup. END
BEGIN NOW —Praises be to God! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said piously. END
BEGIN NOW Bom! END
BEGIN NOW Upset. END
BEGIN NOW A coffin bumped out on to the road. END
BEGIN NOW Burst open. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Dignam END
BEGIN NOW shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large END
BEGIN NOW for him. END
BEGIN NOW Red face: grey now. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth fallen open. END
BEGIN NOW Asking what's up now. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right to close it. END
BEGIN NOW Looks horrid open. END
BEGIN NOW Then the insides decompose END
BEGIN NOW quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Much better to close up all the orifices. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, also. END
BEGIN NOW With wax. END
BEGIN NOW The sphincter loose. END
BEGIN NOW Seal up all. END
BEGIN NOW —Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right. END
BEGIN NOW Dunphy's corner. END
BEGIN NOW Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW pause by the wayside. END
BEGIN NOW Tiptop position for a pub. END
BEGIN NOW Expect we'll pull up END
BEGIN NOW here on the way back to drink his health. END
BEGIN NOW Pass round the consolation. END
BEGIN NOW Elixir of life. END
BEGIN NOW But suppose now it did happen. END
BEGIN NOW Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in END
BEGIN NOW the knocking about? END
BEGIN NOW He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Depends on END
BEGIN NOW where. END
BEGIN NOW The circulation stops. END
BEGIN NOW Still some might ooze out of an artery. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW would be better to bury them in red: a dark red. END
BEGIN NOW In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. END
BEGIN NOW An empty hearse trotted END
BEGIN NOW by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved. END
BEGIN NOW Crossguns bridge: the royal canal. END
BEGIN NOW Water rushed roaring through the sluices. END
BEGIN NOW A man stood on his dropping END
BEGIN NOW barge, between clamps of turf. END
BEGIN NOW On the towpath by the lock a END
BEGIN NOW slacktethered horse. END
BEGIN NOW Aboard of the Bugabu. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes watched him. END
BEGIN NOW On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his END
BEGIN NOW raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, END
BEGIN NOW over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. END
BEGIN NOW Athlone, Mullingar, END
BEGIN NOW Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. END
BEGIN NOW Or END
BEGIN NOW cycle down. END
BEGIN NOW Hire some old crock, safety. END
BEGIN NOW Wren had one the other day at END
BEGIN NOW the auction but a lady's. END
BEGIN NOW Developing waterways. END
BEGIN NOW James M'Cann's hobby to END
BEGIN NOW row me o'er the ferry. END
BEGIN NOW Cheaper transit. END
BEGIN NOW By easy stages. END
BEGIN NOW Houseboats. END
BEGIN NOW Camping out. END
BEGIN NOW Also hearses. END
BEGIN NOW To heaven by water. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I will without END
BEGIN NOW writing. END
BEGIN NOW Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. END
BEGIN NOW Dropping down lock by END
BEGIN NOW lock to Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW With turf from the midland bogs. END
BEGIN NOW Salute. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his END
BEGIN NOW brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. END
BEGIN NOW Near it now. END
BEGIN NOW —I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW —How is that? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Left him weeping, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW —Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage steered left for Finglas road. END
BEGIN NOW The stonecutter's yard on the right. END
BEGIN NOW Last lap. END
BEGIN NOW Crowded on the spit of END
BEGIN NOW land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, END
BEGIN NOW knelt in grief, pointing. END
BEGIN NOW Fragments of shapes, hewn. END
BEGIN NOW In white silence: END
BEGIN NOW appealing. END
BEGIN NOW The best obtainable. END
BEGIN NOW Thos. END
BEGIN NOW H. END
BEGIN NOW Dennany, monumental builder and END
BEGIN NOW sculptor. END
BEGIN NOW Passed. END
BEGIN NOW On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat, END
BEGIN NOW grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown END
BEGIN NOW yawning boot. END
BEGIN NOW After life's journey. END
BEGIN NOW Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power pointed. END
BEGIN NOW —That is where Childs was murdered, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The last house. END
BEGIN NOW —So it is, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW A gruesome case. END
BEGIN NOW Seymour Bushe got him off. END
BEGIN NOW Murdered his brother. END
BEGIN NOW Or so they said. END
BEGIN NOW —The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. END
BEGIN NOW That's the maxim of the END
BEGIN NOW law. END
BEGIN NOW Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person END
BEGIN NOW to be wrongfully condemned. END
BEGIN NOW They looked. END
BEGIN NOW Murderer's ground. END
BEGIN NOW It passed darkly. END
BEGIN NOW Shuttered, tenantless, END
BEGIN NOW unweeded garden. END
BEGIN NOW Whole place gone to hell. END
BEGIN NOW Wrongfully condemned. END
BEGIN NOW Murder. END
BEGIN NOW The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. END
BEGIN NOW They love reading about END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW Man's head found in a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Her clothing consisted of. END
BEGIN NOW How she met END
BEGIN NOW her death. END
BEGIN NOW Recent outrage. END
BEGIN NOW The weapon used. END
BEGIN NOW Murderer is still at large. END
BEGIN NOW Clues. END
BEGIN NOW A shoelace. END
BEGIN NOW The body to be exhumed. END
BEGIN NOW Murder will out. END
BEGIN NOW Cramped in this carriage. END
BEGIN NOW She mightn't like me to come that way without END
BEGIN NOW letting her know. END
BEGIN NOW Must be careful about women. END
BEGIN NOW Catch them once with END
BEGIN NOW their pants down. END
BEGIN NOW Never forgive you after. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. END
BEGIN NOW Dark poplars, END
BEGIN NOW rare white forms. END
BEGIN NOW Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the END
BEGIN NOW trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain END
BEGIN NOW gestures on the air. END
BEGIN NOW The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham put END
BEGIN NOW out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with END
BEGIN NOW his knee. END
BEGIN NOW He stepped out. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed. END
BEGIN NOW Change that soap now. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly END
BEGIN NOW and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand END
BEGIN NOW still held. END
BEGIN NOW Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. END
BEGIN NOW It's all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. END
BEGIN NOW Pomp of death. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and END
BEGIN NOW fruit. END
BEGIN NOW Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Dogbiscuits. END
BEGIN NOW Who ate them? END
BEGIN NOW Mourners coming out. END
BEGIN NOW He followed his companions. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes END
BEGIN NOW walking after them. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took END
BEGIN NOW out the two wreaths. END
BEGIN NOW He handed one to the boy. END
BEGIN NOW Where is that child's funeral disappeared to? END
BEGIN NOW A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, END
BEGIN NOW dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a END
BEGIN NOW granite block. END
BEGIN NOW The waggoner marching at their head saluted. END
BEGIN NOW Coffin now. END
BEGIN NOW Got here before us, dead as he is. END
BEGIN NOW Horse looking round at it END
BEGIN NOW with his plume skeowways. END
BEGIN NOW Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing END
BEGIN NOW on a bloodvessel or something. END
BEGIN NOW Do they know what they cart out here END
BEGIN NOW every day? END
BEGIN NOW Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. END
BEGIN NOW Then Mount END
BEGIN NOW Jerome for the protestants. END
BEGIN NOW Funerals all over the world everywhere every END
BEGIN NOW minute. END
BEGIN NOW Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. END
BEGIN NOW Thousands END
BEGIN NOW every hour. END
BEGIN NOW Too many in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. END
BEGIN NOW Leanjawed harpy, END
BEGIN NOW hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. END
BEGIN NOW Girl's face stained with dirt END
BEGIN NOW and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. END
BEGIN NOW Fish's face, bloodless and livid. END
BEGIN NOW The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. END
BEGIN NOW So END
BEGIN NOW much dead weight. END
BEGIN NOW Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. END
BEGIN NOW First END
BEGIN NOW the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher and the boy END
BEGIN NOW followed with their wreaths. END
BEGIN NOW Who is that beside them? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, the brother- END
BEGIN NOW in-law. END
BEGIN NOW All walked after. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham whispered: END
BEGIN NOW —I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power whispered. END
BEGIN NOW How so? END
BEGIN NOW —His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. END
BEGIN NOW Had the END
BEGIN NOW Queen's hotel in Ennis. END
BEGIN NOW You heard him say he was going to Clare. END
BEGIN NOW Anniversary. END
BEGIN NOW —O God! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power whispered. END
BEGIN NOW First I heard of it. END
BEGIN NOW Poisoned himself? END
BEGIN NOW He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed END
BEGIN NOW towards the cardinal's mausoleum. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking. END
BEGIN NOW —Was he insured? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. END
BEGIN NOW But the policy was heavily mortgaged. END
BEGIN NOW Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane. END
BEGIN NOW —How many children did he leave? END
BEGIN NOW —Five. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's. END
BEGIN NOW —A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. END
BEGIN NOW Five young children. END
BEGIN NOW —A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added. END
BEGIN NOW —Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed. END
BEGIN NOW Has the laugh at him now. END
BEGIN NOW He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. END
BEGIN NOW She had END
BEGIN NOW outlived him. END
BEGIN NOW Lost her husband. END
BEGIN NOW More dead for her than for me. END
BEGIN NOW One must END
BEGIN NOW outlive the other. END
BEGIN NOW Wise men say. END
BEGIN NOW There are more women than men in the END
BEGIN NOW world. END
BEGIN NOW Condole with her. END
BEGIN NOW Your terrible loss. END
BEGIN NOW I hope you'll soon follow END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW For Hindu widows only. END
BEGIN NOW She would marry another. END
BEGIN NOW Him? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Yet who END
BEGIN NOW knows after. END
BEGIN NOW Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. END
BEGIN NOW Drawn on END
BEGIN NOW a guncarriage. END
BEGIN NOW Victoria and Albert. END
BEGIN NOW Frogmore memorial mourning. END
BEGIN NOW But in END
BEGIN NOW the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. END
BEGIN NOW Vain in her heart of END
BEGIN NOW hearts. END
BEGIN NOW All for a shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Consort not even a king. END
BEGIN NOW Her son was the END
BEGIN NOW substance. END
BEGIN NOW Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, END
BEGIN NOW waiting. END
BEGIN NOW It never comes. END
BEGIN NOW One must go first: alone, under the ground: and END
BEGIN NOW lie no more in her warm bed. END
BEGIN NOW —How are you, Simon? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. END
BEGIN NOW Haven't END
BEGIN NOW seen you for a month of Sundays. END
BEGIN NOW —Never better. END
BEGIN NOW How are all in Cork's own town? END
BEGIN NOW —I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert END
BEGIN NOW said. END
BEGIN NOW Same old six and eightpence. END
BEGIN NOW Stopped with Dick Tivy. END
BEGIN NOW —And how is Dick, the solid man? END
BEGIN NOW —Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered. END
BEGIN NOW —By the holy Paul! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. END
BEGIN NOW Dick Tivy bald? END
BEGIN NOW —Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, END
BEGIN NOW pointing ahead. END
BEGIN NOW A few bob a skull. END
BEGIN NOW Just to keep them going till the END
BEGIN NOW insurance is cleared up. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. END
BEGIN NOW Is that the eldest boy in front? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton is END
BEGIN NOW behind. END
BEGIN NOW He put down his name for a quid. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I often told poor Paddy he ought END
BEGIN NOW to mind that job. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry is not the worst in the world. END
BEGIN NOW —How did he lose it? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW Liquor, what? END
BEGIN NOW —Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood behind END
BEGIN NOW the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the END
BEGIN NOW slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. END
BEGIN NOW Poor boy! END
BEGIN NOW Was he there END
BEGIN NOW when the father? END

BEGIN NOW All he might have done. END
BEGIN NOW I owe three END
BEGIN NOW shillings to O'Grady. END
BEGIN NOW Would he understand? END
BEGIN NOW The mutes bore the coffin END
BEGIN NOW into the chapel. END
BEGIN NOW Which end is his head? END
BEGIN NOW After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened END
BEGIN NOW light. END
BEGIN NOW The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow END
BEGIN NOW candles at its corners. END
BEGIN NOW Always in front of us. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher, laying a END
BEGIN NOW wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners END
BEGIN NOW knelt here and there in prayingdesks. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood behind near the END
BEGIN NOW font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper END
BEGIN NOW from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. END
BEGIN NOW He fitted his black END
BEGIN NOW hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously. END
BEGIN NOW A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a END
BEGIN NOW door. END
BEGIN NOW The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one END
BEGIN NOW hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly. END
BEGIN NOW Who'll read the book? END
BEGIN NOW I, said the rook. END
BEGIN NOW They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book END
BEGIN NOW with a fluent croak. END
BEGIN NOW Father Coffey. END
BEGIN NOW I knew his name was like a coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Domine-namine. END
BEGIN NOW Bully END
BEGIN NOW about the muzzle he looks. END
BEGIN NOW Bosses the show. END
BEGIN NOW Muscular christian. END
BEGIN NOW Woe END
BEGIN NOW betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art Peter. END
BEGIN NOW Burst END
BEGIN NOW sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. END
BEGIN NOW With a belly on END
BEGIN NOW him like a poisoned pup. END
BEGIN NOW Most amusing expressions that man finds. END
BEGIN NOW Hhhn: END
BEGIN NOW burst sideways. END
BEGIN NOW —Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine. END

BEGIN NOW Eyes of a toad too. END
BEGIN NOW What swells him up that way? END
BEGIN NOW Molly gets swelled after cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW Air of END
BEGIN NOW the place maybe. END
BEGIN NOW Looks full up of bad gas. END
BEGIN NOW Must be an infernal lot of END
BEGIN NOW bad gas round the place. END
BEGIN NOW Butchers, for instance: they get like raw END
BEGIN NOW beefsteaks. END
BEGIN NOW Who was telling me? END
BEGIN NOW Mervyn Browne. END
BEGIN NOW Down in the vaults of END

BEGIN NOW Out it END
BEGIN NOW rushes: blue. END
BEGIN NOW One whiff of that and you're a goner. END
BEGIN NOW My kneecap is hurting me. END
BEGIN NOW Ow. END
BEGIN NOW That's better. END
BEGIN NOW The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's END
BEGIN NOW bucket and shook it over the coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Then he walked to the other end and END
BEGIN NOW shook it again. END
BEGIN NOW Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. END
BEGIN NOW As you END
BEGIN NOW were before you rested. END
BEGIN NOW It's all written down: he has to do it. END
BEGIN NOW —Et ne nos inducas in tentationem. END
BEGIN NOW The server piped the answers in the treble. END
BEGIN NOW I often thought it would be END
BEGIN NOW better to have boy servants. END
BEGIN NOW Up to fifteen or so. END
BEGIN NOW After that, of course END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW Holy water that was, I expect. END
BEGIN NOW Shaking sleep out of it. END
BEGIN NOW He must be fed END
BEGIN NOW up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. END
BEGIN NOW What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. END
BEGIN NOW Every mortal day END
BEGIN NOW a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in END
BEGIN NOW childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls END
BEGIN NOW with little sparrows' breasts. END
BEGIN NOW All the year round he prayed the same END
BEGIN NOW thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. END
BEGIN NOW On Dignam END
BEGIN NOW now. END
BEGIN NOW —In paradisum. END
BEGIN NOW Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. END
BEGIN NOW Says that over END
BEGIN NOW everybody. END
BEGIN NOW Tiresome kind of a job. END
BEGIN NOW But he has to say something. END
BEGIN NOW The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. END
BEGIN NOW Corny END
BEGIN NOW Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the END
BEGIN NOW coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher END
BEGIN NOW gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW All followed END
BEGIN NOW them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom came last END
BEGIN NOW folding his paper again into his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW He gazed gravely at the ground END
BEGIN NOW till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. END
BEGIN NOW The metal wheels ground the END
BEGIN NOW gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the END
BEGIN NOW trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres. END
BEGIN NOW The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, I mustn't lilt here. END
BEGIN NOW —The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone. END
BEGIN NOW —He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. END
BEGIN NOW But his END
BEGIN NOW heart is buried in Rome. END
BEGIN NOW How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! END
BEGIN NOW —Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll soon be stretched END
BEGIN NOW beside her. END
BEGIN NOW Let Him take me whenever He likes. END
BEGIN NOW Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little END
BEGIN NOW in his walk. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Power took his arm. END
BEGIN NOW —She's better where she is, he said kindly. END
BEGIN NOW —I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose she is in END
BEGIN NOW heaven if there is a heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to END
BEGIN NOW plod by. END
BEGIN NOW —Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head. END
BEGIN NOW —The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose we can END
BEGIN NOW do so too. END
BEGIN NOW We are the last. END
BEGIN NOW This cemetery is a treacherous place. END
BEGIN NOW They covered their heads. END
BEGIN NOW —The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan said with reproof. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Secret END
BEGIN NOW eyes, secretsearching. END
BEGIN NOW Mason, I think: not sure. END
BEGIN NOW Beside him again. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW are the last. END
BEGIN NOW In the same boat. END
BEGIN NOW Hope he'll say something else. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan added: END
BEGIN NOW —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more END
BEGIN NOW impressive I must say. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. END
BEGIN NOW The language of course was another thing. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan said with solemnity: END
BEGIN NOW —I am the resurrection and the life. END
BEGIN NOW That touches a man's inmost heart. END
BEGIN NOW —It does, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with END
BEGIN NOW his toes to the daisies? END
BEGIN NOW No touching that. END
BEGIN NOW Seat of the affections. END
BEGIN NOW Broken heart. END
BEGIN NOW A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood END
BEGIN NOW every day. END
BEGIN NOW One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of END
BEGIN NOW them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. END
BEGIN NOW Old rusty pumps: damn the END
BEGIN NOW thing else. END
BEGIN NOW The resurrection and the life. END
BEGIN NOW Once you are dead you are END
BEGIN NOW dead. END
BEGIN NOW That last day idea. END
BEGIN NOW Knocking them all up out of their graves. END
BEGIN NOW Come END
BEGIN NOW forth, Lazarus! END
BEGIN NOW And he came fifth and lost the job. END
BEGIN NOW Get up! END
BEGIN NOW Last day! END
BEGIN NOW Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the END
BEGIN NOW rest of his traps. END
BEGIN NOW Find damn all of himself that morning. END
BEGIN NOW Pennyweight of END
BEGIN NOW powder in a skull. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve grammes one pennyweight. END
BEGIN NOW Troy measure. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side. END
BEGIN NOW —Everything went off A1, he said. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He looked on them from his drawling eye. END
BEGIN NOW Policeman's shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW With END
BEGIN NOW your tooraloom tooraloom. END
BEGIN NOW —As it should be, Mr Kernan said. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan assured him. END
BEGIN NOW —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton asked. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW know his face. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert glanced back. END
BEGIN NOW —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. END
BEGIN NOW She's his wife. END
BEGIN NOW —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't seen her for some END
BEGIN NOW time. END
BEGIN NOW She was a finelooking woman. END
BEGIN NOW I danced with her, wait, fifteen END
BEGIN NOW seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. END
BEGIN NOW And a good END
BEGIN NOW armful she was. END
BEGIN NOW He looked behind through the others. END
BEGIN NOW —What is he? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW What does he do? END
BEGIN NOW Wasn't he in the stationery END
BEGIN NOW line? END
BEGIN NOW I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert smiled. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. END
BEGIN NOW A traveller for blottingpaper. END
BEGIN NOW —In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like END
BEGIN NOW that for? END
BEGIN NOW She had plenty of game in her then. END
BEGIN NOW —Has still, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW He does some canvassing for ads. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead. END
BEGIN NOW The barrow turned into a side lane. END
BEGIN NOW A portly man, ambushed among the END
BEGIN NOW grasses, raised his hat in homage. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers touched their caps. END
BEGIN NOW —John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. END
BEGIN NOW He never forgets a friend. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said: END
BEGIN NOW —I am come to pay you another visit. END
BEGIN NOW —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want your END
BEGIN NOW custom at all. END
BEGIN NOW Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin END
BEGIN NOW Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe? END
BEGIN NOW —I did not, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke END
BEGIN NOW in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles. END
BEGIN NOW —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy END
BEGIN NOW evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW They asked for END
BEGIN NOW Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. END
BEGIN NOW After END
BEGIN NOW traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. END
BEGIN NOW One of the END
BEGIN NOW drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. END
BEGIN NOW The other drunk was blinking END
BEGIN NOW up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up. END
BEGIN NOW The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW resumed: END
BEGIN NOW —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the END
BEGIN NOW man, says he. END
BEGIN NOW That's not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it. END
BEGIN NOW Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting END
BEGIN NOW the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked. END
BEGIN NOW —That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes. END
BEGIN NOW —I know, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW It's pure END
BEGIN NOW goodheartedness: damn the thing else. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. END
BEGIN NOW All want to be on good END
BEGIN NOW terms with him. END
BEGIN NOW Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. END
BEGIN NOW Keys: END
BEGIN NOW like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. END
BEGIN NOW No passout checks. END
BEGIN NOW Habeas corpus. END
BEGIN NOW I must see about that ad after the funeral. END
BEGIN NOW Did I write END
BEGIN NOW Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me END
BEGIN NOW writing to Martha? END
BEGIN NOW Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. END
BEGIN NOW Be END
BEGIN NOW the better of a shave. END
BEGIN NOW Grey sprouting beard. END
BEGIN NOW That's the first sign when END
BEGIN NOW the hairs come out grey. END
BEGIN NOW And temper getting cross. END
BEGIN NOW Silver threads among END
BEGIN NOW the grey. END
BEGIN NOW Fancy being his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder he had the gumption to propose to END
BEGIN NOW any girl. END
BEGIN NOW Come out and live in the graveyard. END
BEGIN NOW Dangle that before her. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW might thrill her first. END
BEGIN NOW Courting death... END
BEGIN NOW Shades of night hovering here END
BEGIN NOW with all the dead stretched about. END
BEGIN NOW The shadows of the tombs when END
BEGIN NOW churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who END
BEGIN NOW is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the END
BEGIN NOW same like a big giant in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW Will o' the wisp. END
BEGIN NOW Gas of graves. END
BEGIN NOW Want END
BEGIN NOW to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. END
BEGIN NOW Women especially are so END
BEGIN NOW touchy. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever END
BEGIN NOW seen a ghost? END
BEGIN NOW Well, I have. END
BEGIN NOW It was a pitchdark night. END
BEGIN NOW The clock was on END
BEGIN NOW the stroke of twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up. END
BEGIN NOW Whores in Turkish graveyards. END
BEGIN NOW Learn anything if taken young. END
BEGIN NOW You might END
BEGIN NOW pick up a young widow here. END
BEGIN NOW Men like that. END
BEGIN NOW Love among the tombstones. END
BEGIN NOW Romeo. END
BEGIN NOW Spice of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW In the midst of death we are in life. END
BEGIN NOW Both END
BEGIN NOW ends meet. END
BEGIN NOW Tantalising for the poor dead. END
BEGIN NOW Smell of grilled beefsteaks to END
BEGIN NOW the starving. END
BEGIN NOW Gnawing their vitals. END
BEGIN NOW Desire to grig people. END
BEGIN NOW Molly wanting END
BEGIN NOW to do it at the window. END
BEGIN NOW Eight children he has anyway. END
BEGIN NOW He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field END
BEGIN NOW after field. END
BEGIN NOW Holy fields. END
BEGIN NOW More room if they buried them standing. END
BEGIN NOW Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. END
BEGIN NOW Standing? END
BEGIN NOW His head might come up some END
BEGIN NOW day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. END
BEGIN NOW All honeycombed END
BEGIN NOW the ground must be: oblong cells. END
BEGIN NOW And very neat he keeps it too: trim END
BEGIN NOW grass and edgings. END
BEGIN NOW His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. END
BEGIN NOW Well, so END
BEGIN NOW it is. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to be flowers of sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Chinese cemeteries with giant END
BEGIN NOW poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. END
BEGIN NOW The Botanic END
BEGIN NOW Gardens are just over there. END
BEGIN NOW It's the blood sinking in the earth gives END
BEGIN NOW new life. END
BEGIN NOW Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. END
BEGIN NOW Every END
BEGIN NOW man his price. END
BEGIN NOW Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable END
BEGIN NOW for fruit garden. END
BEGIN NOW A bargain. END
BEGIN NOW By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor END
BEGIN NOW and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. END
BEGIN NOW With END
BEGIN NOW thanks. END
BEGIN NOW I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, END
BEGIN NOW nails. END
BEGIN NOW Charnelhouses. END
BEGIN NOW Dreadful. END
BEGIN NOW Turning green and pink decomposing. END
BEGIN NOW Rot END
BEGIN NOW quick in damp earth. END
BEGIN NOW The lean old ones tougher. END
BEGIN NOW Then a kind of a tallowy END
BEGIN NOW kind of a cheesy. END
BEGIN NOW Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW Then dried up. END
BEGIN NOW Deathmoths. END
BEGIN NOW Of course the cells or whatever they END
BEGIN NOW are go on living. END
BEGIN NOW Changing about. END
BEGIN NOW Live for ever practically. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing to END
BEGIN NOW feed on feed on themselves. END
BEGIN NOW But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. END
BEGIN NOW Soil must be simply END
BEGIN NOW swirling with them. END
BEGIN NOW Your head it simply swurls. END
BEGIN NOW Those pretty little END
BEGIN NOW seaside gurls. END
BEGIN NOW He looks cheerful enough over it. END
BEGIN NOW Gives him a sense of END
BEGIN NOW power seeing all the others go under first. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how he looks at life. END
BEGIN NOW Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. END
BEGIN NOW The one about END
BEGIN NOW the bulletin. END
BEGIN NOW Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. END
BEGIN NOW this morning. END
BEGIN NOW 11 p.m. END
BEGIN NOW (closing time). END
BEGIN NOW Not arrived yet. END
BEGIN NOW Peter. END
BEGIN NOW The dead themselves the men END
BEGIN NOW anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in END
BEGIN NOW fashion. END
BEGIN NOW A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Keep out END
BEGIN NOW the damp. END
BEGIN NOW You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. END
BEGIN NOW Gravediggers in Hamlet. END
BEGIN NOW Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. END
BEGIN NOW Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. END
BEGIN NOW De mortuis nil nisi END
BEGIN NOW prius. END
BEGIN NOW Go out of mourning first. END
BEGIN NOW Hard to imagine his funeral. END
BEGIN NOW Seems a END
BEGIN NOW sort of a joke. END
BEGIN NOW Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. END
BEGIN NOW Gives you second wind. END
BEGIN NOW New lease of life. END
BEGIN NOW —How many have-you for tomorrow? END
BEGIN NOW the caretaker asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Two, Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW Half ten and eleven. END
BEGIN NOW The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW The barrow had ceased to END
BEGIN NOW trundle. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping END
BEGIN NOW with care round the graves. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its END
BEGIN NOW nose on the brink, looping the bands round it. END
BEGIN NOW Burying him. END
BEGIN NOW We come to bury CÃ¦sar. END
BEGIN NOW His ides of March or June. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW doesn't know who is here nor care. END
BEGIN NOW Now who is that lankylooking galoot END
BEGIN NOW over there in the macintosh? END
BEGIN NOW Now who is he I'd like to know? END
BEGIN NOW Now I'd END
BEGIN NOW give a trifle to know who he is. END
BEGIN NOW Always someone turns up you never END
BEGIN NOW dreamt of. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he END
BEGIN NOW could. END
BEGIN NOW Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he END
BEGIN NOW could dig his own grave. END
BEGIN NOW We all do. END
BEGIN NOW Only man buries. END
BEGIN NOW No, ants too. END
BEGIN NOW First END
BEGIN NOW thing strikes anybody. END
BEGIN NOW Bury the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Say Robinson Crusoe was true to END
BEGIN NOW life. END
BEGIN NOW Well then Friday buried him. END
BEGIN NOW Every Friday buries a Thursday if you END
BEGIN NOW come to look at it. END
BEGIN NOW O, poor Robinson Crusoe! END
BEGIN NOW How could you possibly do so? END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dignam! END
BEGIN NOW His last lie on the earth in his box. END
BEGIN NOW When you think of END
BEGIN NOW them all it does seem a waste of wood. END
BEGIN NOW All gnawed through. END
BEGIN NOW They could END
BEGIN NOW invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that END
BEGIN NOW way. END
BEGIN NOW Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. END
BEGIN NOW They're so particular. END
BEGIN NOW Lay me in my native earth. END
BEGIN NOW Bit of clay from the END
BEGIN NOW holy land. END
BEGIN NOW Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one END
BEGIN NOW coffin. END
BEGIN NOW I see what it means. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW To protect him as long as possible END
BEGIN NOW even in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW The Irishman's house is his coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Embalming in END
BEGIN NOW catacombs, mummies the same idea. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve. END
BEGIN NOW I'm thirteen. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. END
BEGIN NOW Death's END
BEGIN NOW number. END
BEGIN NOW Where the deuce did he pop out of? END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't in the chapel, that END
BEGIN NOW I'll swear. END
BEGIN NOW Silly superstition that about thirteen. END
BEGIN NOW Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. END
BEGIN NOW Tinge of purple. END
BEGIN NOW I had one END
BEGIN NOW like that when we lived in Lombard street west. END
BEGIN NOW Dressy fellow he was END
BEGIN NOW once. END
BEGIN NOW Used to change three suits in the day. END
BEGIN NOW Must get that grey suit of END
BEGIN NOW mine turned by Mesias. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW It's dyed. END
BEGIN NOW His wife I forgot he's not END
BEGIN NOW married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him. END
BEGIN NOW The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the END
BEGIN NOW gravetrestles. END
BEGIN NOW They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW If we were all suddenly somebody else. END
BEGIN NOW Far away a donkey brayed. END
BEGIN NOW Rain. END
BEGIN NOW No such ass. END
BEGIN NOW Never see a dead one, they END
BEGIN NOW say. END
BEGIN NOW Shame of death. END
BEGIN NOW They hide. END
BEGIN NOW Also poor papa went away. END
BEGIN NOW Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. END
BEGIN NOW Whisper. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in END
BEGIN NOW the black open space. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. END
BEGIN NOW Wellcut frockcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it is a long rest. END
BEGIN NOW Feel no more. END
BEGIN NOW It's the moment you feel. END
BEGIN NOW Must be END
BEGIN NOW damned unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Can't believe it at first. END
BEGIN NOW Mistake must be: someone END
BEGIN NOW else. END
BEGIN NOW Try the house opposite. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, I wanted to. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't yet. END
BEGIN NOW Then END
BEGIN NOW darkened deathchamber. END
BEGIN NOW Light they want. END
BEGIN NOW Whispering around you. END
BEGIN NOW Would you END
BEGIN NOW like to see a priest? END
BEGIN NOW Then rambling and wandering. END
BEGIN NOW Delirium all you hid END
BEGIN NOW all your life. END
BEGIN NOW The death struggle. END
BEGIN NOW His sleep is not natural. END
BEGIN NOW Press his END
BEGIN NOW lower eyelid. END
BEGIN NOW Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the END
BEGIN NOW soles of his feet yellow. END
BEGIN NOW Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the END
BEGIN NOW floor since he's doomed. END
BEGIN NOW Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing END
BEGIN NOW him a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Dying to embrace her in his shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Last act of Lucia. END
BEGIN NOW Shall END
BEGIN NOW I nevermore behold thee? END
BEGIN NOW Bam! END
BEGIN NOW He expires. END
BEGIN NOW Gone at last. END
BEGIN NOW People talk END
BEGIN NOW about you a bit: forget you. END
BEGIN NOW Don't forget to pray for him. END
BEGIN NOW Remember him END
BEGIN NOW in your prayers. END
BEGIN NOW Even Parnell. END
BEGIN NOW Ivy day dying out. END
BEGIN NOW Then they follow: END
BEGIN NOW dropping into a hole, one after the other. END
BEGIN NOW We are praying now for the repose of his soul. END
BEGIN NOW Hoping you're well and END
BEGIN NOW not in hell. END
BEGIN NOW Nice change of air. END
BEGIN NOW Out of the fryingpan of life into the END
BEGIN NOW fire of purgatory. END
BEGIN NOW Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? END
BEGIN NOW They say you do when END
BEGIN NOW you shiver in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Someone walking over it. END
BEGIN NOW Callboy's warning. END
BEGIN NOW Near END
BEGIN NOW you. END
BEGIN NOW Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. END
BEGIN NOW Mamma, poor END
BEGIN NOW mamma, and little Rudy. END
BEGIN NOW The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in END
BEGIN NOW on the coffin. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned away his face. END
BEGIN NOW And if he was alive all END
BEGIN NOW the time? END
BEGIN NOW Whew! END
BEGIN NOW By jingo, that would be awful! END
BEGIN NOW No, no: he is dead, of END
BEGIN NOW course. END
BEGIN NOW Of course he is dead. END
BEGIN NOW Monday he died. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to have some END
BEGIN NOW law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a END
BEGIN NOW telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. END
BEGIN NOW Flag of END
BEGIN NOW distress. END
BEGIN NOW Three days. END
BEGIN NOW Rather long to keep them in summer. END
BEGIN NOW Just as well END
BEGIN NOW to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no. END
BEGIN NOW The clay fell softer. END
BEGIN NOW Begin to be forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW Out of sight, out of mind. END
BEGIN NOW The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. END
BEGIN NOW Had enough of END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves END
BEGIN NOW without show. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its END
BEGIN NOW way deftly through the maze of graves. END
BEGIN NOW Quietly, sure of his ground, he END
BEGIN NOW traversed the dismal fields. END
BEGIN NOW Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, the names. END
BEGIN NOW But he END
BEGIN NOW knows them all. END
BEGIN NOW No: coming to me. END
BEGIN NOW —I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. END
BEGIN NOW What is your END
BEGIN NOW christian name? END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure. END
BEGIN NOW —L, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW And you might put down M'Coy's name too. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW asked me to. END
BEGIN NOW —Charley, Hynes said writing. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW He was on the Freeman once. END
BEGIN NOW So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW idea a postmortem for doctors. END
BEGIN NOW Find out what they imagine they know. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW died of a Tuesday. END
BEGIN NOW Got the run. END
BEGIN NOW Levanted with the cash of a few ads. END
BEGIN NOW Charley, you're my darling. END
BEGIN NOW That was why he asked me to. END
BEGIN NOW O well, does no END
BEGIN NOW harm. END
BEGIN NOW I saw to that, M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, old chap: much obliged. END

BEGIN NOW —And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was END
BEGIN NOW over there in the... END
BEGIN NOW He looked around. END
BEGIN NOW —Macintosh. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Where is he now? END
BEGIN NOW —M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know who he is. END
BEGIN NOW Is that his END
BEGIN NOW name? END
BEGIN NOW He moved away, looking about him. END
BEGIN NOW —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. END
BEGIN NOW I say, Hynes! END
BEGIN NOW Didn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Where has he disappeared to? END
BEGIN NOW Not a sign. END
BEGIN NOW Well of all END
BEGIN NOW the. END
BEGIN NOW Has anybody here seen? END
BEGIN NOW Kay ee double ell. END
BEGIN NOW Become invisible. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW Lord, what became of him? END
BEGIN NOW A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade. END
BEGIN NOW —O, excuse me! END
BEGIN NOW He stepped aside nimbly. END
BEGIN NOW Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. END
BEGIN NOW It rose. END
BEGIN NOW Nearly over. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their END
BEGIN NOW spades. END
BEGIN NOW All uncovered again for a few instants. END
BEGIN NOW The boy propped his END
BEGIN NOW wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards END
BEGIN NOW the barrow. END
BEGIN NOW Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. END
BEGIN NOW One bent END
BEGIN NOW to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. END
BEGIN NOW One, leaving his mates, END
BEGIN NOW walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. END
BEGIN NOW Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. END
BEGIN NOW His navelcord. END
BEGIN NOW The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, sir: trouble. END
BEGIN NOW Headshake. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW For END
BEGIN NOW yourselves just. END
BEGIN NOW The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at END
BEGIN NOW whiles to read a name on a tomb. END
BEGIN NOW —Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW We have time. END
BEGIN NOW —Let us, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW With awe Mr END
BEGIN NOW Power's blank voice spoke: END
BEGIN NOW —Some say he is not in that grave at all. END
BEGIN NOW That the coffin was filled END
BEGIN NOW with stones. END
BEGIN NOW That one day he will come again. END
BEGIN NOW Hynes shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW —Parnell will never come again, he said. END
BEGIN NOW He's there, all that was mortal END
BEGIN NOW of him. END
BEGIN NOW Peace to his ashes. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, END
BEGIN NOW broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old END
BEGIN NOW Ireland's hearts and hands. END
BEGIN NOW More sensible to spend the money on some END

BEGIN NOW Old Dr Murren's. END
BEGIN NOW The great physician called him home. END
BEGIN NOW Well it's God's END

BEGIN NOW Nice country residence. END
BEGIN NOW Newly plastered and painted. END
BEGIN NOW Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. END
BEGIN NOW Marriage ads END
BEGIN NOW they never try to beautify. END
BEGIN NOW Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of END

BEGIN NOW Better value that for the money. END
BEGIN NOW Still, the flowers are more END
BEGIN NOW poetical. END

BEGIN NOW Like stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW Like the END

BEGIN NOW Hoo! END
BEGIN NOW Not a budge out of him. END
BEGIN NOW Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. END

BEGIN NOW Ought to be END
BEGIN NOW sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland was END
BEGIN NOW dedicated to it or whatever that. END
BEGIN NOW Seems anything but pleased. END
BEGIN NOW Why this END
BEGIN NOW infliction? END
BEGIN NOW Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket END
BEGIN NOW of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the END

BEGIN NOW Apollo that was. END
BEGIN NOW How many! END
BEGIN NOW All these here once walked round Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Faithful departed. END
BEGIN NOW As END
BEGIN NOW you are now so once were we. END
BEGIN NOW Besides how could you remember everybody? END
BEGIN NOW Eyes, walk, voice. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the END

BEGIN NOW For instance who? END
BEGIN NOW For instance some fellow that died END
BEGIN NOW when I was in Wisdom Hely's. END
BEGIN NOW Rtststr! END
BEGIN NOW A rattle of pebbles. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW He looked down intently into a stone crypt. END
BEGIN NOW Some animal. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW There he END
BEGIN NOW goes. END
BEGIN NOW An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the END

BEGIN NOW An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. END
BEGIN NOW The grey END

BEGIN NOW Good hidingplace for treasure. END
BEGIN NOW Who lives there? END
BEGIN NOW Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. END
BEGIN NOW Robert Emmet was END
BEGIN NOW buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? END
BEGIN NOW Making his rounds. END
BEGIN NOW Tail gone now. END
BEGIN NOW One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. END

BEGIN NOW gone bad. END
BEGIN NOW Well and what's cheese? END

BEGIN NOW Yes, Menton. END
BEGIN NOW Got his rag out END
BEGIN NOW that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. END
BEGIN NOW Pure fluke END
BEGIN NOW of mine: the bias. END
BEGIN NOW Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. END
BEGIN NOW Hate at END
BEGIN NOW first sight. END
BEGIN NOW Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, END
BEGIN NOW laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by. END
BEGIN NOW Got a dinge in the side of his hat. END
BEGIN NOW Carriage probably. END
BEGIN NOW —Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them. END
BEGIN NOW They stopped. END
BEGIN NOW —Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving. END
BEGIN NOW —There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton took END
BEGIN NOW off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his END
BEGIN NOW coatsleeve. END
BEGIN NOW He clapped the hat on his head again. END
BEGIN NOW —It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, he said shortly. END
BEGIN NOW They walked on towards the gates. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a END
BEGIN NOW few paces so as not to overhear. END
BEGIN NOW Martin laying down the law. END
BEGIN NOW Martin END
BEGIN NOW could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his END

BEGIN NOW Never mind. END
BEGIN NOW Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. END
BEGIN NOW Get the pull over him that way. END

BEGIN NOW —There it is, Red Murray said. END

BEGIN NOW The door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. END
BEGIN NOW Davy Stephens, minute in a END

BEGIN NOW in four clean strokes. END
BEGIN NOW Scissors and paste. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut END

BEGIN NOW —Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind END
BEGIN NOW his ear, we can do him one. END
BEGIN NOW —Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. END
BEGIN NOW I'll rub that in. END
BEGIN NOW We. END
BEGIN NOW WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT END
BEGIN NOW Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered: END

BEGIN NOW Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. END
BEGIN NOW It passed statelily up the staircase, END

BEGIN NOW Red Murray whispered. END
BEGIN NOW The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. END
BEGIN NOW They always build END

BEGIN NOW Way in. END
BEGIN NOW Way out. END
BEGIN NOW Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. END
BEGIN NOW Mary, Martha. END
BEGIN NOW Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor. END
BEGIN NOW —Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Red Murray agreed. END
BEGIN NOW But Mario was said to be the picture of Our END
BEGIN NOW Saviour. END
BEGIN NOW Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. END
BEGIN NOW Hand on his END

BEGIN NOW In Martha. END
BEGIN NOW Co-ome thou lost one, Co-ome thou dear one! END

BEGIN NOW —Freeman! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said slowly: END
BEGIN NOW —Well, he is one of our saviours also. END
BEGIN NOW A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed END
BEGIN NOW in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along END
BEGIN NOW the now reverberating boards. END
BEGIN NOW But will he save the circulation? END
BEGIN NOW Thumping. END
BEGIN NOW Thumping. END
BEGIN NOW He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn END

BEGIN NOW Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards END
BEGIN NOW Nannetti's reading closet. END
BEGIN NOW WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST END

BEGIN NOW Want a cool head. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said. END
BEGIN NOW Soon be calling him my lord mayor. END
BEGIN NOW Long John is backing him, they say. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet END
BEGIN NOW and made a sign to a typesetter. END
BEGIN NOW He handed the sheet silently over the END
BEGIN NOW dirty glass screen. END
BEGIN NOW —Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood in his way. END
BEGIN NOW —If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, END
BEGIN NOW pointing backward with his thumb. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you? END
BEGIN NOW Hynes asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Mm, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Look sharp and you'll catch him. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanks, old man, Hynes said. END

BEGIN NOW Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. END
BEGIN NOW Three weeks. END

BEGIN NOW WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk. END
BEGIN NOW —Excuse me, councillor, he said. END
BEGIN NOW This ad, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Keyes, you remember? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded. END
BEGIN NOW —He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman moved his pencil towards it. END
BEGIN NOW —But wait, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He wants it changed. END
BEGIN NOW Keyes, you see. END
BEGIN NOW He wants END
BEGIN NOW two keys at the top. END
BEGIN NOW Hell of a racket they make. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't hear it. END
BEGIN NOW Nannan. END
BEGIN NOW Iron nerves. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he understands what I. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began END
BEGIN NOW to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket. END
BEGIN NOW —Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top. END
BEGIN NOW Let him take that in first. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the END
BEGIN NOW foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the END
BEGIN NOW obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Clank it. END
BEGIN NOW Clank it. END
BEGIN NOW Miles END
BEGIN NOW of it unreeled. END
BEGIN NOW What becomes of it after? END
BEGIN NOW O, wrap up meat, parcels: END
BEGIN NOW various uses, thousand and one things. END
BEGIN NOW Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew END
BEGIN NOW swiftly on the scarred woodwork. END
BEGIN NOW HOUSE OF KEY(E)S END
BEGIN NOW —Like that, see. END
BEGIN NOW Two crossed keys here. END
BEGIN NOW A circle. END
BEGIN NOW Then here the name. END
BEGIN NOW Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. END
BEGIN NOW So on. END
BEGIN NOW Better not teach him his own business. END
BEGIN NOW —You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. END
BEGIN NOW Then round the top END
BEGIN NOW in leaded: the house of keys. END
BEGIN NOW You see? END
BEGIN NOW Do you think that's a good idea? END
BEGIN NOW The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched END
BEGIN NOW there quietly. END
BEGIN NOW —The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. END
BEGIN NOW You know, councillor, END
BEGIN NOW the Manx parliament. END
BEGIN NOW Innuendo of home rule. END
BEGIN NOW Tourists, you know, from the END
BEGIN NOW isle of Man. END
BEGIN NOW Catches the eye, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Can you do that? END
BEGIN NOW I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. END
BEGIN NOW But then if END
BEGIN NOW he didn't know only make it awkward for him. END
BEGIN NOW Better not. END
BEGIN NOW —We can do that, the foreman said. END
BEGIN NOW Have you the design? END
BEGIN NOW —I can get it, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW It was in a Kilkenny paper. END
BEGIN NOW He has a house END
BEGIN NOW there too. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just run out and ask him. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you can do that and just END
BEGIN NOW a little par calling attention. END
BEGIN NOW You know the usual. END
BEGIN NOW Highclass licensed END
BEGIN NOW premises. END
BEGIN NOW Longfelt want. END
BEGIN NOW So on. END
BEGIN NOW The foreman thought for an instant. END
BEGIN NOW —We can do that, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Let him give us a three months' renewal. END
BEGIN NOW A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. END
BEGIN NOW He began to check it END
BEGIN NOW silently. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching END
BEGIN NOW the silent typesetters at their cases. END
BEGIN NOW ORTHOGRAPHICAL END
BEGIN NOW Want to be sure of his spelling. END
BEGIN NOW Proof fever. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham forgot END

BEGIN NOW Cemetery put in of course on END

BEGIN NOW I should have said when he clapped on his topper. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I ought to END

BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW I could have END

BEGIN NOW NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR END
BEGIN NOW The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the archbishop's letter? END
BEGIN NOW It's to be repeated in the END
BEGIN NOW Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW Where's what's his name? END
BEGIN NOW He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines. END
BEGIN NOW —Monks, sir? END
BEGIN NOW a voice asked from the castingbox. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Monks? END
BEGIN NOW —Monks! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom took up his cutting. END
BEGIN NOW Time to get out. END
BEGIN NOW —Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it a END

BEGIN NOW —Monks! END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END

BEGIN NOW that's the other. END
BEGIN NOW Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons. END
BEGIN NOW And then the END
BEGIN NOW lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the END
BEGIN NOW butcher. END
BEGIN NOW And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the END
BEGIN NOW ox and the dog kills the cat. END
BEGIN NOW Sounds a bit silly till you come to look END
BEGIN NOW into it well. END
BEGIN NOW Justice it means but it's everybody eating everyone else. END
BEGIN NOW That's what life is after all. END
BEGIN NOW How quickly he does that job. END
BEGIN NOW Practice END
BEGIN NOW makes perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Seems to see with his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to END
BEGIN NOW the landing. END
BEGIN NOW Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch END
BEGIN NOW him out perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Better phone him up first. END
BEGIN NOW Number? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Same as END
BEGIN NOW Citron's house. END
BEGIN NOW Twentyeight. END
BEGIN NOW Twentyeight double four. END

BEGIN NOW Looks as if they did it for a bet. END

BEGIN NOW Ah, the soap END
BEGIN NOW I put there. END
BEGIN NOW Lose it out of that pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Putting back his handkerchief END
BEGIN NOW he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket END
BEGIN NOW of his trousers. END
BEGIN NOW What perfume does your wife use? END
BEGIN NOW I could go home still: tram: something END
BEGIN NOW I forgot. END
BEGIN NOW Just to see: before: dressing. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW A sudden screech of laughter came from the Evening Telegraph office. END
BEGIN NOW Know who that is. END
BEGIN NOW What's up? END
BEGIN NOW Pop in a minute to phone. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert it END
BEGIN NOW is. END
BEGIN NOW He entered softly. END
BEGIN NOW ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA END
BEGIN NOW —The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the END
BEGIN NOW dusty windowpane. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing END
BEGIN NOW face, asked of it sourly: END
BEGIN NOW —Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: END
BEGIN NOW —Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on END
BEGIN NOW its way, tho' quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling END
BEGIN NOW waters of Neptune's blue domain, 'mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest END
BEGIN NOW zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows cast END
BEGIN NOW o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the END
BEGIN NOW forest. END
BEGIN NOW What about that, Simon? END
BEGIN NOW he asked over the fringe of his END
BEGIN NOW newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW How's that for high? END
BEGIN NOW —Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: END
BEGIN NOW —The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. END
BEGIN NOW O boys! END
BEGIN NOW O boys! END
BEGIN NOW —And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on END
BEGIN NOW the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea. END
BEGIN NOW —That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to END
BEGIN NOW hear any more of the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, END
BEGIN NOW hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand. END
BEGIN NOW High falutin stuff. END
BEGIN NOW Bladderbags. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. END
BEGIN NOW Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. END
BEGIN NOW He has influence they say. END
BEGIN NOW Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his END
BEGIN NOW greatgranduncle. END
BEGIN NOW Close on ninety they say. END
BEGIN NOW Subleader for his death END
BEGIN NOW written this long time perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Living to spite them. END
BEGIN NOW Might go first END
BEGIN NOW himself. END
BEGIN NOW Johnny, make room for your uncle. END
BEGIN NOW The right honourable Hedges END
BEGIN NOW Eyre Chatterton. END
BEGIN NOW Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on END
BEGIN NOW gale days. END
BEGIN NOW Windfall when he kicks out. END
BEGIN NOW Alleluia. END
BEGIN NOW —Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW —What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW —A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered END
BEGIN NOW with pomp of tone. END
BEGIN NOW Our lovely land. END
BEGIN NOW SHORT BUT TO THE POINT END
BEGIN NOW —Whose land? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom said simply. END
BEGIN NOW —Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. END
BEGIN NOW With an END
BEGIN NOW accent on the whose. END
BEGIN NOW —Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW —Is it his speech last night? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert nodded. END
BEGIN NOW —But listen to this, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was END
BEGIN NOW pushed in. END
BEGIN NOW —Excuse me, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, entering. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside. END
BEGIN NOW —I beg yours, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW —Come in. END
BEGIN NOW Come in. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day. END
BEGIN NOW —How are you, Dedalus? END
BEGIN NOW —Well. END
BEGIN NOW And yourself? END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW SAD END
BEGIN NOW Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. END
BEGIN NOW Decline, poor chap. END
BEGIN NOW That hectic flush spells finis for a man. END
BEGIN NOW Touch and go with him. END
BEGIN NOW What's END
BEGIN NOW in the wind, I wonder. END
BEGIN NOW Money worry. END
BEGIN NOW —Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks. END
BEGIN NOW —You're looking extra. END
BEGIN NOW —Is the editor to be seen? END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy asked, looking towards the END
BEGIN NOW inner door. END
BEGIN NOW —Very much so, professor MacHugh said. END
BEGIN NOW To be seen and heard. END
BEGIN NOW He's in his END
BEGIN NOW sanctum with Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the END
BEGIN NOW pink pages of the file. END
BEGIN NOW Practice dwindling. END
BEGIN NOW A mighthavebeen. END
BEGIN NOW Losing heart. END
BEGIN NOW Gambling. END
BEGIN NOW Debts of END
BEGIN NOW honour. END
BEGIN NOW Reaping the whirlwind. END
BEGIN NOW Used to get good retainers from D. END
BEGIN NOW and T. END
BEGIN NOW Fitzgerald. END
BEGIN NOW Their wigs to show the grey matter. END
BEGIN NOW Brains on their sleeve END
BEGIN NOW like the statue in Glasnevin. END
BEGIN NOW Believe he does some literary work for the END
BEGIN NOW Express with Gabriel Conroy. END
BEGIN NOW Wellread fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford began on END
BEGIN NOW the Independent. END
BEGIN NOW Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they END
BEGIN NOW get wind of a new opening. END
BEGIN NOW Weathercocks. END
BEGIN NOW Hot and cold in the same END
BEGIN NOW breath. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't know which to believe. END
BEGIN NOW One story good till you hear the END
BEGIN NOW next. END
BEGIN NOW Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows END
BEGIN NOW over. END
BEGIN NOW Hail fellow well met the next moment. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, listen to this for God' sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. END
BEGIN NOW Or again if we END
BEGIN NOW but climb the serried mountain peaks... END
BEGIN NOW —Bombast! END
BEGIN NOW the professor broke in testily. END
BEGIN NOW Enough of the inflated END
BEGIN NOW windbag! END
BEGIN NOW —Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, towering high on high, to bathe our souls, END
BEGIN NOW as it were... END
BEGIN NOW —Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Blessed and eternal God! END
BEGIN NOW Yes? END
BEGIN NOW Is he END
BEGIN NOW taking anything for it? END
BEGIN NOW —As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio, unmatched, END
BEGIN NOW despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for END
BEGIN NOW very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious END
BEGIN NOW pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent END
BEGIN NOW glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... END
BEGIN NOW HIS NATIVE DORIC END
BEGIN NOW —The moon, professor MacHugh said. END
BEGIN NOW He forgot Hamlet. END
BEGIN NOW —That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of END
BEGIN NOW the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... END
BEGIN NOW —O! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. END
BEGIN NOW Shite and onions! END
BEGIN NOW That'll do, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Life is too short. END
BEGIN NOW He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy END
BEGIN NOW moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. END
BEGIN NOW An END
BEGIN NOW instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's END
BEGIN NOW unshaven blackspectacled face. END
BEGIN NOW —Doughy Daw! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT WETHERUP SAID END
BEGIN NOW All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot END
BEGIN NOW cake that stuff. END
BEGIN NOW He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? END
BEGIN NOW Why they call END
BEGIN NOW him Doughy Daw. END
BEGIN NOW Feathered his nest well anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW Daughter engaged to that END
BEGIN NOW chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. END
BEGIN NOW Hooked that nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Entertainments. END
BEGIN NOW Open house. END
BEGIN NOW Big blowout. END
BEGIN NOW Wetherup always said that. END
BEGIN NOW Get END
BEGIN NOW a grip of them by the stomach. END
BEGIN NOW The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested END
BEGIN NOW by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. END
BEGIN NOW The bold blue eyes stared END
BEGIN NOW about them and the harsh voice asked: END
BEGIN NOW —What is it? END
BEGIN NOW —And here comes the sham squire himself! END
BEGIN NOW professor MacHugh said grandly. END
BEGIN NOW —Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! END
BEGIN NOW the editor said in recognition. END
BEGIN NOW —Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. END
BEGIN NOW I must get a drink END
BEGIN NOW after that. END
BEGIN NOW —Drink! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried. END
BEGIN NOW No drinks served before mass. END
BEGIN NOW —Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. END
BEGIN NOW The editor's blue eyes roved END
BEGIN NOW towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile. END
BEGIN NOW —Will you join us, Myles? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED END
BEGIN NOW —North Cork militia! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW won every time! END
BEGIN NOW North Cork and Spanish officers! END
BEGIN NOW —Where was that, Myles? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at END
BEGIN NOW his toecaps. END
BEGIN NOW —In Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW the editor shouted. END
BEGIN NOW —So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed. END
BEGIN NOW Passing out he whispered to J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy: END
BEGIN NOW —Incipient jigs. END
BEGIN NOW Sad case. END
BEGIN NOW —Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. END
BEGIN NOW My Ohio! END
BEGIN NOW —A perfect cretic! END
BEGIN NOW the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW Long, short and long. END
BEGIN NOW O, HARP EOLIAN! END
BEGIN NOW He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking END
BEGIN NOW off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant END
BEGIN NOW unwashed teeth. END
BEGIN NOW —Bingbang, bangbang. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door. END
BEGIN NOW —Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I just want to phone about an ad. END
BEGIN NOW He went in. END
BEGIN NOW —What about that leader this evening? END
BEGIN NOW professor MacHugh asked, coming to END
BEGIN NOW the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW —That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. END
BEGIN NOW Never you fret. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW That's all right. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day, Myles, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip END
BEGIN NOW limply back on the file. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Canada swindle case on today? END
BEGIN NOW The telephone whirred inside. END
BEGIN NOW —Twentyeight... END
BEGIN NOW No, twenty... END
BEGIN NOW Double four... END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW SPOT THE WINNER END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan came out of the inner office with SPORT'S tissues. END
BEGIN NOW —Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Sceptre with O. END
BEGIN NOW Madden up. END
BEGIN NOW He tossed the tissues on to the table. END
BEGIN NOW Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was END
BEGIN NOW flung open. END
BEGIN NOW —Hush, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW I hear feetstoops. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin END
BEGIN NOW by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the END
BEGIN NOW steps. END
BEGIN NOW The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air END
BEGIN NOW blue scrawls and under the table came to earth. END
BEGIN NOW —It wasn't me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW It was the big fellow shoved me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW There's a hurricane END
BEGIN NOW blowing. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he END
BEGIN NOW stooped twice. END
BEGIN NOW —Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. END
BEGIN NOW It was Pat END
BEGIN NOW Farrell shoved me, sir. END
BEGIN NOW He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe. END
BEGIN NOW —Him, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly. END
BEGIN NOW He hustled the boy out and banged the door to. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: END
BEGIN NOW —Continued on page six, column four. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Evening Telegraph here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW Is END
BEGIN NOW the boss...? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Telegraph... END
BEGIN NOW To where? END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW Which auction rooms ?... END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW I see... END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW I'll catch him. END
BEGIN NOW A COLLISION ENSUES END
BEGIN NOW The bell whirred again as he rang off. END
BEGIN NOW He came in quickly and bumped END
BEGIN NOW against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue. END
BEGIN NOW —Pardon, monsieur, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making END
BEGIN NOW a grimace. END
BEGIN NOW —My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. END
BEGIN NOW Are you hurt? END
BEGIN NOW I'm in a END
BEGIN NOW hurry. END
BEGIN NOW —Knee, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: END
BEGIN NOW —The accumulation of the anno Domini. END
BEGIN NOW —Sorry, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy slapped END
BEGIN NOW the heavy pages over. END
BEGIN NOW The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, END
BEGIN NOW echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: END
BEGIN NOW —We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand. END
BEGIN NOW EXIT BLOOM END
BEGIN NOW —I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad END
BEGIN NOW of Keyes's. END
BEGIN NOW Want to fix it up. END
BEGIN NOW They tell me he's round there in END
BEGIN NOW Dillon's. END
BEGIN NOW He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. END
BEGIN NOW The editor who, END
BEGIN NOW leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, END
BEGIN NOW suddenly stretched forth an arm amply. END
BEGIN NOW —Begone! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW The world is before you. END
BEGIN NOW —Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them, END
BEGIN NOW blowing them apart gently, without comment. END
BEGIN NOW —He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his END
BEGIN NOW blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the young scamps END
BEGIN NOW after him. END
BEGIN NOW —Show. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan cried, running to the window. END
BEGIN NOW A STREET CORTÃˆGE END
BEGIN NOW Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a END
BEGIN NOW tail of white bowknots. END
BEGIN NOW —Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and END
BEGIN NOW you'll kick. END
BEGIN NOW O, my rib risible! END
BEGIN NOW Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. END
BEGIN NOW Small nines. END
BEGIN NOW Steal upon larks. END
BEGIN NOW He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet END
BEGIN NOW past the fireplace to J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his END
BEGIN NOW receiving hands. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said with a start. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the other two END
BEGIN NOW gone? END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW the professor said, turning. END
BEGIN NOW They're gone round to the Oval for a END
BEGIN NOW drink. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. END
BEGIN NOW Came over last night. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on then, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW Where's my hat? END
BEGIN NOW He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his END
BEGIN NOW jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. END
BEGIN NOW They jingled then in the END
BEGIN NOW air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer. END
BEGIN NOW —He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW —Seems to be, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in END
BEGIN NOW murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. END
BEGIN NOW Who has the most END
BEGIN NOW matches? END
BEGIN NOW THE CALUMET OF PEACE END
BEGIN NOW He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan END
BEGIN NOW promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanky vous, Lenehan said, helping himself. END
BEGIN NOW The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: END
BEGIN NOW —'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, 'Twas empire charmed thy heart. END
BEGIN NOW The professor grinned, locking his long lips. END
BEGIN NOW —Eh? END
BEGIN NOW You bloody old Roman empire? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW He took a cigarette from the open case. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, lighting it for him END
BEGIN NOW with quick grace, said: END
BEGIN NOW —Silence for my brandnew riddle! END
BEGIN NOW —Imperium romanum, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said gently. END
BEGIN NOW It sounds nobler than END
BEGIN NOW British or Brixton. END
BEGIN NOW The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire. END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW —That's it, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We are the fat. END
BEGIN NOW You and I are the fat in the fire. END
BEGIN NOW We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell. END
BEGIN NOW THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME END
BEGIN NOW —Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. END
BEGIN NOW We think of Rome, END
BEGIN NOW imperial, imperious, imperative. END
BEGIN NOW He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: END
BEGIN NOW —What was their civilisation? END
BEGIN NOW Vast, I allow: but vile. END
BEGIN NOW Cloacae: sewers. END
BEGIN NOW The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be END
BEGIN NOW here. END
BEGIN NOW Let us build an altar to Jehovah. END
BEGIN NOW The Roman, like the Englishman END
BEGIN NOW who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set END
BEGIN NOW his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW gazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. END
BEGIN NOW Let us END
BEGIN NOW construct a watercloset. END
BEGIN NOW —Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Our old ancient ancestors, END
BEGIN NOW as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the END
BEGIN NOW running stream. END
BEGIN NOW —They were nature's gentlemen, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy murmured. END
BEGIN NOW But we have also END
BEGIN NOW Roman law. END
BEGIN NOW —And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy asked. END
BEGIN NOW It was at the royal university dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Everything was going swimmingly END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW —First my riddle, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ready? END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from END
BEGIN NOW the hallway. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered. END
BEGIN NOW —Entrez, mes enfants! END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan cried. END
BEGIN NOW —I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. END
BEGIN NOW Youth led by END
BEGIN NOW Experience visits Notoriety. END
BEGIN NOW —How do you do? END
BEGIN NOW the editor said, holding out a hand. END
BEGIN NOW Come in. END
BEGIN NOW Your END
BEGIN NOW governor is just gone. END
BEGIN NOW ??? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said to all: END
BEGIN NOW —Silence! END
BEGIN NOW What opera resembles a railwayline? END
BEGIN NOW Reflect, ponder, END
BEGIN NOW excogitate, reply. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and END
BEGIN NOW signature. END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW the editor asked. END
BEGIN NOW Bit torn off. END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —That old pelters, the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW Who tore it? END
BEGIN NOW Was he short taken? END
BEGIN NOW On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth END
BEGIN NOW to my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their END
BEGIN NOW shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Foot and mouth? END
BEGIN NOW Are you turned...? END
BEGIN NOW Bullockbefriending bard. END
BEGIN NOW SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT END
BEGIN NOW —Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. END
BEGIN NOW The letter is not mine. END
BEGIN NOW Mr END
BEGIN NOW Garrett Deasy asked me to... END
BEGIN NOW —O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW bloodiest old tartar God ever made. END
BEGIN NOW By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth END
BEGIN NOW disease and no mistake! END
BEGIN NOW The night she threw the soup in the waiter's END
BEGIN NOW face in the Star and Garter. END
BEGIN NOW Oho! END
BEGIN NOW A woman brought sin into the world. END
BEGIN NOW For Helen, the runaway wife of END
BEGIN NOW Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. END
BEGIN NOW O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. END
BEGIN NOW —Is he a widower? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the END
BEGIN NOW typescript. END
BEGIN NOW Emperor's horses. END
BEGIN NOW Habsburg. END
BEGIN NOW An Irishman saved his life on END
BEGIN NOW the ramparts of Vienna. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you forget! END
BEGIN NOW Maximilian Karl O'Donnell, END
BEGIN NOW graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Sent his heir over to make the king an END
BEGIN NOW Austrian fieldmarshal now. END
BEGIN NOW Going to be trouble there one day. END
BEGIN NOW Wild END
BEGIN NOW geese. END
BEGIN NOW O yes, every time. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you forget that! END
BEGIN NOW —The moot point is did he forget it, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said quietly, END
BEGIN NOW turning a horseshoe paperweight. END
BEGIN NOW Saving princes is a thank you job. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh turned on him. END
BEGIN NOW —And if not? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. END
BEGIN NOW A Hungarian it was one END
BEGIN NOW day... END
BEGIN NOW LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED END
BEGIN NOW —We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW Success for us END
BEGIN NOW is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. END
BEGIN NOW We were never END
BEGIN NOW loyal to the successful. END
BEGIN NOW We serve them. END
BEGIN NOW I teach the blatant Latin END
BEGIN NOW language. END
BEGIN NOW I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is END
BEGIN NOW the maxim: time is money. END
BEGIN NOW Material domination. END
BEGIN NOW Dominus! END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Where is END
BEGIN NOW the spirituality? END
BEGIN NOW Lord Jesus? END
BEGIN NOW Lord Salisbury? END
BEGIN NOW A sofa in a westend club. END
BEGIN NOW But the Greek! END
BEGIN NOW KYRIE ELEISON! END
BEGIN NOW A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long END
BEGIN NOW lips. END
BEGIN NOW —The Greek! END
BEGIN NOW he said again. END
BEGIN NOW Kyrios! END
BEGIN NOW Shining word! END
BEGIN NOW The vowels the Semite END
BEGIN NOW and the Saxon know not. END
BEGIN NOW Kyrie! END
BEGIN NOW The radiance of the intellect. END
BEGIN NOW I ought to END
BEGIN NOW profess Greek, the language of the mind. END
BEGIN NOW Kyrie eleison! END
BEGIN NOW The closetmaker END
BEGIN NOW and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. END
BEGIN NOW We are liege END
BEGIN NOW subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar END
BEGIN NOW and of the empire of the spirit, not an imperium, that went under with END
BEGIN NOW the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW They went under. END
BEGIN NOW Pyrrhus, END
BEGIN NOW misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of END
BEGIN NOW Greece. END
BEGIN NOW Loyal to a lost cause. END
BEGIN NOW He strode away from them towards the window. END
BEGIN NOW —They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they END
BEGIN NOW always fell. END
BEGIN NOW —Boohoo! END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan wept with a little noise. END
BEGIN NOW Owing to a brick received in END
BEGIN NOW the latter half of the matinÃ©e. END
BEGIN NOW Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! END
BEGIN NOW He whispered then near Stephen's ear: END
BEGIN NOW LENEHAN'S LIMERICK END
BEGIN NOW There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue. END
BEGIN NOW As he END
BEGIN NOW mostly sees double To wear them why trouble? END
BEGIN NOW I can't see the Joe Miller. END
BEGIN NOW Can you? END
BEGIN NOW In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. END
BEGIN NOW Whose mother is beastly dead. END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket. END
BEGIN NOW —That'll be all right, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll read the rest after. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all END
BEGIN NOW right. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan extended his hands in protest. END
BEGIN NOW —But my riddle! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW What opera is like a railwayline? END
BEGIN NOW —Opera? END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan announced gladly: END
BEGIN NOW —The Rose of Castile. END
BEGIN NOW See the wheeze? END
BEGIN NOW Rows of cast steel. END
BEGIN NOW Gee! END
BEGIN NOW He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke fell END
BEGIN NOW back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp. END
BEGIN NOW —Help! END
BEGIN NOW he sighed. END
BEGIN NOW I feel a strong weakness. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling END
BEGIN NOW tissues. END
BEGIN NOW The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties. END
BEGIN NOW —Paris, past and present, he said. END
BEGIN NOW You look like communards. END
BEGIN NOW —Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said in quiet END
BEGIN NOW mockery. END
BEGIN NOW Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you? END
BEGIN NOW You look as though you had done the deed. END
BEGIN NOW General Bobrikoff. END
BEGIN NOW OMNIUM GATHERUM END
BEGIN NOW —We were only thinking about it, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —All the talents, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW Law, the classics... END
BEGIN NOW —The turf, Lenehan put in. END
BEGIN NOW —Literature, the press. END
BEGIN NOW —If Bloom were here, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW The gentle art of END
BEGIN NOW advertisement. END
BEGIN NOW —And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. END
BEGIN NOW The vocal muse. END
BEGIN NOW Dublin's END
BEGIN NOW prime favourite. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan gave a loud cough. END
BEGIN NOW —Ahem! END
BEGIN NOW he said very softly. END
BEGIN NOW O, for a fresh of breath air! END
BEGIN NOW I caught a END
BEGIN NOW cold in the park. END
BEGIN NOW The gate was open. END
BEGIN NOW "YOU CAN DO IT!" END
BEGIN NOW The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW —I want you to write something for me, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Something with a bite in END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW You can do it. END
BEGIN NOW I see it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW In the lexicon of youth ... END
BEGIN NOW See it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW See it in your eye. END
BEGIN NOW Lazy idle little schemer. END
BEGIN NOW —Foot and mouth disease! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried in scornful invective. END
BEGIN NOW Great END
BEGIN NOW nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. END
BEGIN NOW All balls! END
BEGIN NOW Bulldosing the END
BEGIN NOW public! END
BEGIN NOW Give them something with a bite in it. END
BEGIN NOW Put us all into it, damn END
BEGIN NOW its soul. END
BEGIN NOW Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy. END
BEGIN NOW —We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare. END
BEGIN NOW —He wants you for the pressgang, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said. END
BEGIN NOW THE GREAT GALLAHER END
BEGIN NOW —You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis. END
BEGIN NOW Wait a minute. END
BEGIN NOW We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say END
BEGIN NOW when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. END
BEGIN NOW Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. END
BEGIN NOW That was a pen. END
BEGIN NOW You know how he END
BEGIN NOW made his mark? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW That was the smartest piece of journalism END
BEGIN NOW ever known. END
BEGIN NOW That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the END
BEGIN NOW invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I END
BEGIN NOW suppose. END
BEGIN NOW I'll show you. END
BEGIN NOW He pushed past them to the files. END
BEGIN NOW —Look at here, he said turning. END
BEGIN NOW The New York World cabled for a special. END
BEGIN NOW Remember that time? END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh nodded. END
BEGIN NOW —New York World, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat. END
BEGIN NOW Where it took place. END
BEGIN NOW Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Joe Brady and the END
BEGIN NOW rest of them. END
BEGIN NOW Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. END
BEGIN NOW Whole route, see? END
BEGIN NOW —Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW Fitzharris. END
BEGIN NOW He has that cabman's END
BEGIN NOW shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Holohan told me. END
BEGIN NOW You know END
BEGIN NOW Holohan? END
BEGIN NOW —Hop and carry one, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW —And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for END
BEGIN NOW the corporation. END
BEGIN NOW A night watchman. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned in surprise. END
BEGIN NOW —Gumley? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW You don't say so? END
BEGIN NOW A friend of my father's, is it? END
BEGIN NOW —Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. END
BEGIN NOW Let Gumley mind the END
BEGIN NOW stones, see they don't run away. END
BEGIN NOW Look at here. END
BEGIN NOW What did Ignatius END
BEGIN NOW Gallaher do? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Inspiration of genius. END
BEGIN NOW Cabled right away. END
BEGIN NOW Have you Weekly Freeman of 17 March? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW Have you got that? END
BEGIN NOW He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point. END
BEGIN NOW —Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. END
BEGIN NOW Have END
BEGIN NOW you got that? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW The telephone whirred. END
BEGIN NOW A DISTANT VOICE END
BEGIN NOW —I'll answer it, the professor said, going. END
BEGIN NOW —B is parkgate. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating. END
BEGIN NOW —T is viceregal lodge. END
BEGIN NOW C is where murder took place. END
BEGIN NOW K is Knockmaroon END
BEGIN NOW gate. END
BEGIN NOW The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. END
BEGIN NOW An illstarched END
BEGIN NOW dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his END
BEGIN NOW waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello? END
BEGIN NOW Evening Telegraph here... END
BEGIN NOW Hello?... END
BEGIN NOW Who's there?... END
BEGIN NOW Yes... END
BEGIN NOW Yes... END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW —F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, END
BEGIN NOW Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. END
BEGIN NOW F.A.B.P. END
BEGIN NOW Got that? END
BEGIN NOW X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street. END
BEGIN NOW The professor came to the inner door. END
BEGIN NOW —Bloom is at the telephone, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. END
BEGIN NOW X is Davy's publichouse, END
BEGIN NOW see? END
BEGIN NOW CLEVER, VERY END
BEGIN NOW —Clever, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW Very. END
BEGIN NOW —Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody END
BEGIN NOW history. END
BEGIN NOW Nightmare from which you will never awake. END
BEGIN NOW —I saw it, the editor said proudly. END
BEGIN NOW I was present. END
BEGIN NOW Dick Adams, the END
BEGIN NOW besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and END
BEGIN NOW myself. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: END
BEGIN NOW —Madam, I'm Adam. END
BEGIN NOW And Able was I ere I saw Elba. END
BEGIN NOW —History! END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford cried. END
BEGIN NOW The Old Woman of Prince's street was END
BEGIN NOW there first. END
BEGIN NOW There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. END
BEGIN NOW Out of END
BEGIN NOW an advertisement. END
BEGIN NOW Gregor Grey made the design for it. END
BEGIN NOW That gave him the END
BEGIN NOW leg up. END
BEGIN NOW Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star. END
BEGIN NOW Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. END
BEGIN NOW That's press. END
BEGIN NOW That's talent. END
BEGIN NOW Pyatt! END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW was all their daddies! END
BEGIN NOW —The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother-in- END
BEGIN NOW law of Chris Callinan. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello?... END
BEGIN NOW Are you there?... END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he's here still. END
BEGIN NOW Come across yourself. END
BEGIN NOW —Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW flung the pages down. END
BEGIN NOW —Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke. END
BEGIN NOW —Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW Professor MacHugh came from the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW —Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers END
BEGIN NOW were up before the recorder? END
BEGIN NOW —O yes, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Dudley was walking home END
BEGIN NOW through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that END
BEGIN NOW cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW And it turned END
BEGIN NOW out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin- END
BEGIN NOW the-Goat. END
BEGIN NOW Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! END
BEGIN NOW —They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW Press and the bar! END
BEGIN NOW Where have you a man now at the bar like those END
BEGIN NOW fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan. END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, bloody nonsense. END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW Only in the halfpenny place. END
BEGIN NOW His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain. END
BEGIN NOW Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? END
BEGIN NOW How do you know? END
BEGIN NOW Why did you END
BEGIN NOW write it then? END
BEGIN NOW RHYMES AND REASONS END
BEGIN NOW Mouth, south. END
BEGIN NOW Is the mouth south someway? END
BEGIN NOW Or the south a mouth? END
BEGIN NOW Must be END
BEGIN NOW some. END
BEGIN NOW South, pout, out, shout, drouth. END
BEGIN NOW Rhymes: two men dressed the same, END
BEGIN NOW looking the same, two by two. END
BEGIN NOW ........................ END
BEGIN NOW la tua pace .................. END
BEGIN NOW che parlar ti END
BEGIN NOW piace Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace. END
BEGIN NOW He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in END
BEGIN NOW russet, entwining, per l'aer perso, in mauve, in purple, quella pacifica END
BEGIN NOW oriafiamma, gold of oriflamme, di rimirar fÃ¨ piÃ¹ ardenti. END
BEGIN NOW But I old END
BEGIN NOW men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb END
BEGIN NOW womb. END
BEGIN NOW —Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY... END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage. END
BEGIN NOW —My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false END
BEGIN NOW construction on my words. END
BEGIN NOW I hold no brief, as at present advised, for END
BEGIN NOW the third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away END
BEGIN NOW with you. END
BEGIN NOW Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and END
BEGIN NOW Edmund Burke? END
BEGIN NOW Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, END
BEGIN NOW Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery END
BEGIN NOW guttersheet not to mention Paddy Kelly's Budget, Pue's Occurrences and END
BEGIN NOW our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle. END
BEGIN NOW Why bring in a master of END
BEGIN NOW forensic eloquence like Whiteside? END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient for the day is the END
BEGIN NOW newspaper thereof. END
BEGIN NOW LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE END
BEGIN NOW —Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his END
BEGIN NOW face. END
BEGIN NOW Irish volunteers. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you now? END
BEGIN NOW Established 1763. END
BEGIN NOW Dr Lucas. END
BEGIN NOW Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? END
BEGIN NOW Psha! END
BEGIN NOW —Well, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example. END
BEGIN NOW —Bushe? END
BEGIN NOW the editor said. END
BEGIN NOW Well, yes: Bushe, yes. END
BEGIN NOW He has a strain of it in END
BEGIN NOW his blood. END
BEGIN NOW Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe. END
BEGIN NOW —He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW But no matter. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: END
BEGIN NOW —One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life END
BEGIN NOW fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. END
BEGIN NOW It was in that case of fratricide, END
BEGIN NOW the Childs murder case. END
BEGIN NOW Bushe defended him. END
BEGIN NOW And in the porches of mine ear did pour. END
BEGIN NOW By the way how did he find that out? END
BEGIN NOW He died in his sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Or the other END
BEGIN NOW story, beast with two backs? END
BEGIN NOW —What was that? END
BEGIN NOW the professor asked. END
BEGIN NOW ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM END
BEGIN NOW —He spoke on the law of evidence, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, of Roman justice END
BEGIN NOW as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis. END
BEGIN NOW And he END
BEGIN NOW cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican. END
BEGIN NOW —Ha. END
BEGIN NOW —A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase. END
BEGIN NOW False lull. END
BEGIN NOW Something quite ordinary. END
BEGIN NOW Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. END
BEGIN NOW I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that END
BEGIN NOW it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, END
BEGIN NOW that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. END
BEGIN NOW A POLISHED PERIOD END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words: END
BEGIN NOW —He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, END
BEGIN NOW of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy END
BEGIN NOW which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought END
BEGIN NOW in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, END
BEGIN NOW deserves to live. END
BEGIN NOW His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall. END
BEGIN NOW —Fine! END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said at once. END
BEGIN NOW —The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said. END
BEGIN NOW —You like it? END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy asked Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW took a cigarette from the case. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy offered his case to Myles END
BEGIN NOW Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, END
BEGIN NOW saying: END
BEGIN NOW —Muchibus thankibus. END
BEGIN NOW A MAN OF HIGH MORALE END
BEGIN NOW —Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said to END
BEGIN NOW Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush END
BEGIN NOW poets: A. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW the mastermystic? END
BEGIN NOW That Blavatsky woman started it. END
BEGIN NOW She was END
BEGIN NOW a nice old bag of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW has been telling some yankee interviewer END
BEGIN NOW that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about END
BEGIN NOW planes of consciousness. END
BEGIN NOW Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. END
BEGIN NOW E.'s leg. END
BEGIN NOW He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking about me. END
BEGIN NOW What did he say? END
BEGIN NOW What did he say? END
BEGIN NOW What did he say END
BEGIN NOW about me? END
BEGIN NOW Don't ask. END
BEGIN NOW —No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. END
BEGIN NOW Wait a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Let me say one thing. END
BEGIN NOW The finest display of oratory I END
BEGIN NOW ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical END
BEGIN NOW society. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had END
BEGIN NOW spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), END
BEGIN NOW advocating the revival of the Irish tongue. END
BEGIN NOW He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: END
BEGIN NOW —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. END
BEGIN NOW Then you can imagine the style of his END
BEGIN NOW discourse. END
BEGIN NOW —He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said, rumour has it, on END
BEGIN NOW the Trinity college estates commission. END
BEGIN NOW —He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's END
BEGIN NOW frock. END
BEGIN NOW Go on. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, END
BEGIN NOW full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will END
BEGIN NOW not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely END
BEGIN NOW upon the new movement. END
BEGIN NOW It was then a new movement. END
BEGIN NOW We were weak, END
BEGIN NOW therefore worthless. END
BEGIN NOW He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an END
BEGIN NOW outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and END
BEGIN NOW ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new END
BEGIN NOW focus. END
BEGIN NOW IMPROMPTU END
BEGIN NOW In ferial tone he addressed J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy: END
BEGIN NOW —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. END
BEGIN NOW That he had END
BEGIN NOW prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one END
BEGIN NOW shorthandwriter in the hall. END
BEGIN NOW His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy END
BEGIN NOW beard round it. END
BEGIN NOW He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he END
BEGIN NOW looked (though he was not) a dying man. END
BEGIN NOW His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy's towards END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his END
BEGIN NOW withering hair. END
BEGIN NOW Still seeking, he said: END
BEGIN NOW —When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. END
BEGIN NOW Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these. END
BEGIN NOW He raised his head firmly. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes bethought themselves once more. END
BEGIN NOW Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet. END
BEGIN NOW He began: END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening END
BEGIN NOW to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my END
BEGIN NOW learned friend. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to me that I had been transported into a END
BEGIN NOW country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, END
BEGIN NOW that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of END
BEGIN NOW some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses. END
BEGIN NOW His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes END
BEGIN NOW ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. END
BEGIN NOW And let our END
BEGIN NOW crooked smokes. END
BEGIN NOW Noble words coming. END
BEGIN NOW Look out. END
BEGIN NOW Could you try your hand at END
BEGIN NOW it yourself? END
BEGIN NOW —And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest END
BEGIN NOW raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. END
BEGIN NOW I heard his words END
BEGIN NOW and their meaning was revealed to me. END
BEGIN NOW FROM THE FATHERS END
BEGIN NOW It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted END
BEGIN NOW which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good END
BEGIN NOW could be corrupted. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, curse you! END
BEGIN NOW That's saint Augustine. END
BEGIN NOW —Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our END
BEGIN NOW language? END
BEGIN NOW You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our END
BEGIN NOW galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise END
BEGIN NOW furrow the waters of the known globe. END
BEGIN NOW You have but emerged from END
BEGIN NOW primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong END
BEGIN NOW history and a polity. END
BEGIN NOW Nile. END
BEGIN NOW Child, man, effigy. END
BEGIN NOW By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple END
BEGIN NOW in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone. END
BEGIN NOW —You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and END
BEGIN NOW mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. END
BEGIN NOW Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. END
BEGIN NOW Israel is END
BEGIN NOW weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her END
BEGIN NOW arms. END
BEGIN NOW Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at END
BEGIN NOW our name. END
BEGIN NOW A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his voice above it END
BEGIN NOW boldly: END
BEGIN NOW —But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and END
BEGIN NOW accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and END
BEGIN NOW bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have END
BEGIN NOW brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed END
BEGIN NOW the pillar of the cloud by day. END
BEGIN NOW He would never have spoken with the END
BEGIN NOW Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down END
BEGIN NOW with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in END
BEGIN NOW his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. END
BEGIN NOW OMINOUS—FOR HIM! END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said not without regret: END
BEGIN NOW —And yet he died without having entered the land of promise. END
BEGIN NOW —A sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often— END
BEGIN NOW previously—expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. END
BEGIN NOW And with a great future END
BEGIN NOW behind him. END
BEGIN NOW The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering END
BEGIN NOW up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW —That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. END
BEGIN NOW Gone with the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. END
BEGIN NOW Miles of ears of porches. END
BEGIN NOW The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the four winds. END
BEGIN NOW A people END
BEGIN NOW sheltered within his voice. END
BEGIN NOW Dead noise. END
BEGIN NOW Akasic records of all that ever END
BEGIN NOW anywhere wherever was. END
BEGIN NOW Love and laud him: me no more. END
BEGIN NOW I have money. END
BEGIN NOW —Gentlemen, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW As the next motion on the agenda paper may I END
BEGIN NOW suggest that the house do now adjourn? END
BEGIN NOW —You take my breath away. END
BEGIN NOW It is not perchance a French compliment? END
BEGIN NOW Mr END
BEGIN NOW O'Madden Burke asked. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, END
BEGIN NOW metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry. END
BEGIN NOW —That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. END
BEGIN NOW All that are in favour END
BEGIN NOW say ay, Lenehan announced. END
BEGIN NOW The contrary no. END
BEGIN NOW I declare it carried. END
BEGIN NOW To END
BEGIN NOW which particular boosing shed?... END
BEGIN NOW My casting vote is: Mooney's! END
BEGIN NOW He led the way, admonishing: END
BEGIN NOW —We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, END
BEGIN NOW we will not. END
BEGIN NOW By no manner of means. END
BEGIN NOW Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his END
BEGIN NOW umbrella: END
BEGIN NOW —Lay on, Macduff! END
BEGIN NOW —Chip of the old block! END
BEGIN NOW the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the END
BEGIN NOW shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go. END
BEGIN NOW Where are those blasted keys? END
BEGIN NOW He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets. END
BEGIN NOW —Foot and mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be all right. END
BEGIN NOW That'll go in. END
BEGIN NOW Where are END
BEGIN NOW they? END
BEGIN NOW That's all right. END
BEGIN NOW He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. END
BEGIN NOW LET US HOPE END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: END
BEGIN NOW —I hope you will live to see it published. END
BEGIN NOW Myles, one moment. END
BEGIN NOW He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him. END
BEGIN NOW —Come along, Stephen, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW That is fine, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW It has END
BEGIN NOW the prophetic vision. END
BEGIN NOW Fuit Ilium! END
BEGIN NOW The sack of windy Troy. END
BEGIN NOW Kingdoms of END
BEGIN NOW this world. END
BEGIN NOW The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today. END
BEGIN NOW The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and END
BEGIN NOW rushed out into the street, yelling: END
BEGIN NOW —Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW I have much, much to learn. END
BEGIN NOW They turned to the left along Abbey street. END
BEGIN NOW —I have a vision too, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes? END
BEGIN NOW the professor said, skipping to get into step. END
BEGIN NOW Crawford will END
BEGIN NOW follow. END
BEGIN NOW Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: END
BEGIN NOW —Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN END
BEGIN NOW Dubliners. END
BEGIN NOW —Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty END
BEGIN NOW and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane. END
BEGIN NOW —Where is that? END
BEGIN NOW the professor asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Off Blackpitts, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Damp night reeking of hungry dough. END
BEGIN NOW Against the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Face glistering END
BEGIN NOW tallow under her fustian shawl. END
BEGIN NOW Frantic hearts. END
BEGIN NOW Akasic records. END
BEGIN NOW Quicker, END
BEGIN NOW darlint! END
BEGIN NOW On now. END
BEGIN NOW Dare it. END
BEGIN NOW Let there be life. END
BEGIN NOW —They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies END
BEGIN NOW with the blade of a knife. END
BEGIN NOW Two and three in silver and one and seven in END
BEGIN NOW coppers. END
BEGIN NOW They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their END
BEGIN NOW umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain. END
BEGIN NOW —Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said. END
BEGIN NOW LIFE ON THE RAW END
BEGIN NOW —They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at END
BEGIN NOW the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, END
BEGIN NOW proprietress... END
BEGIN NOW They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at END
BEGIN NOW the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to END
BEGIN NOW waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each END
BEGIN NOW other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the END
BEGIN NOW brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, END
BEGIN NOW peeping at the airslits. END
BEGIN NOW Glory be to God. END
BEGIN NOW They had no idea it was that END
BEGIN NOW high. END
BEGIN NOW Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. END
BEGIN NOW Anne Kearns has the END
BEGIN NOW lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got END
BEGIN NOW a bottleful from a passionist father. END
BEGIN NOW Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen END
BEGIN NOW and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW —Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. END
BEGIN NOW Vestal virgins. END
BEGIN NOW I can see END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW What's keeping our friend? END
BEGIN NOW He turned. END
BEGIN NOW A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all END
BEGIN NOW directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. END
BEGIN NOW Hard after them END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet END
BEGIN NOW face, talking with J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy. END
BEGIN NOW —Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm. END
BEGIN NOW He set off again to walk by Stephen's side. END
BEGIN NOW RETURN OF BLOOM END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I see them. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the END
BEGIN NOW offices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal, called: END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Crawford! END
BEGIN NOW A moment! END
BEGIN NOW —Telegraph! END
BEGIN NOW Racing special! END
BEGIN NOW —What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace. END
BEGIN NOW A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face: END
BEGIN NOW —Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! END
BEGIN NOW A child bit by a bellows! END
BEGIN NOW INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR END
BEGIN NOW —Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, END
BEGIN NOW puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW I spoke with Mr Keyes END
BEGIN NOW just now. END
BEGIN NOW He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. END
BEGIN NOW After he'll see. END
BEGIN NOW But he wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday END
BEGIN NOW pink. END
BEGIN NOW And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told councillor END
BEGIN NOW Nannetti from the Kilkenny People. END
BEGIN NOW I can have access to it in the END
BEGIN NOW national library. END
BEGIN NOW House of keys, don't you see? END
BEGIN NOW His name is Keyes. END
BEGIN NOW It's END
BEGIN NOW a play on the name. END
BEGIN NOW But he practically promised he'd give the renewal. END
BEGIN NOW But he wants just a little puff. END
BEGIN NOW What will I tell him, Mr Crawford? END
BEGIN NOW K.M.A. END
BEGIN NOW —Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said throwing out END
BEGIN NOW his arm for emphasis. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him that straight from the stable. END
BEGIN NOW A bit nervy. END
BEGIN NOW Look out for squalls. END
BEGIN NOW All off for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW Arm in arm. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. END
BEGIN NOW Usual blarney. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is END
BEGIN NOW that young Dedalus the moving spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Has a good pair of boots on him END
BEGIN NOW today. END
BEGIN NOW Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. END
BEGIN NOW Been walking in END
BEGIN NOW muck somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Careless chap. END
BEGIN NOW What was he doing in Irishtown? END
BEGIN NOW —Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I END
BEGIN NOW suppose it's worth a short par. END
BEGIN NOW He'd give the ad, I think. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell END
BEGIN NOW him.... END
BEGIN NOW K.M.R.I.A. END
BEGIN NOW —He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his END
BEGIN NOW shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Any time he likes, tell him. END
BEGIN NOW While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on END
BEGIN NOW jerkily. END
BEGIN NOW RAISING THE WIND END
BEGIN NOW —Nulla bona, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. END
BEGIN NOW I'm up to END
BEGIN NOW here. END
BEGIN NOW I've been through the hoop myself. END
BEGIN NOW I was looking for a fellow to END
BEGIN NOW back a bill for me no later than last week. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW You must take END
BEGIN NOW the will for the deed. END
BEGIN NOW With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind END
BEGIN NOW anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. END
BEGIN NOW They caught up END
BEGIN NOW on the others and walked abreast. END
BEGIN NOW —When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty END
BEGIN NOW fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the END
BEGIN NOW railings. END
BEGIN NOW —Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW Two old END
BEGIN NOW Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar. END
BEGIN NOW SOME COLUMN!—THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID END
BEGIN NOW —That's new, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW That's copy. END
BEGIN NOW Out for the waxies END
BEGIN NOW Dargle. END
BEGIN NOW Two old trickies, what? END
BEGIN NOW —But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. END
BEGIN NOW They see the END
BEGIN NOW roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines' blue END
BEGIN NOW dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. END
BEGIN NOW But it makes them giddy END
BEGIN NOW to look so they pull up their skirts... END
BEGIN NOW THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES END
BEGIN NOW —Easy all, Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW No poetic licence. END
BEGIN NOW We're in the END
BEGIN NOW archdiocese here. END
BEGIN NOW —And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue END
BEGIN NOW of the onehandled adulterer. END
BEGIN NOW —Onehandled adulterer! END
BEGIN NOW the professor cried. END
BEGIN NOW I like that. END
BEGIN NOW I see the idea. END
BEGIN NOW I see what you mean. END
BEGIN NOW DAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF END
BEGIN NOW —It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too END
BEGIN NOW tired to look up or down or to speak. END
BEGIN NOW They put the bag of plums between END
BEGIN NOW them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with END
BEGIN NOW their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and END
BEGIN NOW spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings. END
BEGIN NOW He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan and Mr O'Madden END
BEGIN NOW Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's. END
BEGIN NOW —Finished? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford said. END
BEGIN NOW So long as they do no worse. END
BEGIN NOW SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. END
BEGIN NOW SPARTANS GNASH END
BEGIN NOW MOLARS. END
BEGIN NOW ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP. END
BEGIN NOW —You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of END
BEGIN NOW Gorgias, the sophist. END
BEGIN NOW It is said of him that none could tell if he were END
BEGIN NOW bitterer against others or against himself. END
BEGIN NOW He was the son of a noble END
BEGIN NOW and a bondwoman. END
BEGIN NOW And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of END
BEGIN NOW beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Penelope Rich. END
BEGIN NOW They made ready to cross O'Connell street. END
BEGIN NOW HELLO THERE, CENTRAL! END
BEGIN NOW At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless END
BEGIN NOW trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, END
BEGIN NOW Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend END
BEGIN NOW and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, END
BEGIN NOW all still, becalmed in short circuit. END
BEGIN NOW Hackney cars, cabs, delivery END
BEGIN NOW waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with END
BEGIN NOW rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE? END
BEGIN NOW —But what do you call it? END
BEGIN NOW Myles Crawford asked. END
BEGIN NOW Where did they get the END
BEGIN NOW plums? END
BEGIN NOW VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. END
BEGIN NOW SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES. END
BEGIN NOW —Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to END
BEGIN NOW reflect. END
BEGIN NOW Call it, let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Call it: deus nobis hÃ¦c otia fecit. END
BEGIN NOW —No, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable END
BEGIN NOW of The Plums. END
BEGIN NOW —I see, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed richly. END
BEGIN NOW —I see, he said again with new pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Moses and the promised land. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW gave him that idea, he added to J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy. END
BEGIN NOW HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held END
BEGIN NOW his peace. END
BEGIN NOW —I see, the professor said. END
BEGIN NOW He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson END
BEGIN NOW through the meshes of his wry smile. END
BEGIN NOW DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. END
BEGIN NOW ANNE WIMBLES, END
BEGIN NOW FLO WANGLES—YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM? END
BEGIN NOW —Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. END
BEGIN NOW That tickles me, I must END
BEGIN NOW say. END
BEGIN NOW —Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's END
BEGIN NOW truth was known. END

BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. END
BEGIN NOW Elijah thirtytwo feet END

BEGIN NOW Not a bit. END
BEGIN NOW The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of END

BEGIN NOW Also the END

BEGIN NOW But then why is it that saltwater fish are END
BEGIN NOW not salty? END
BEGIN NOW How is that? END
BEGIN NOW His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor END

BEGIN NOW Kino's 11/- Trousers END
BEGIN NOW Good idea that. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Think no more about END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW After one. END
BEGIN NOW Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. END
BEGIN NOW Dunsink time. END
BEGIN NOW Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. END
BEGIN NOW Parallax. END
BEGIN NOW I never END

BEGIN NOW There's a priest. END
BEGIN NOW Could ask him. END
BEGIN NOW Par it's Greek: END

BEGIN NOW Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her END
BEGIN NOW about the transmigration. END
BEGIN NOW O rocks! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. END
BEGIN NOW She's right END
BEGIN NOW after all. END
BEGIN NOW Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. END
BEGIN NOW She's not exactly witty. END
BEGIN NOW Can be rude too. END
BEGIN NOW Blurt out what I was thinking. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone END
BEGIN NOW voice. END
BEGIN NOW He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a END
BEGIN NOW barrel. END
BEGIN NOW Now, isn't that wit. END
BEGIN NOW They used to call him big Ben. END
BEGIN NOW Not half as END

BEGIN NOW Powerful man he was at stowing away number END
BEGIN NOW one Bass. END
BEGIN NOW Barrel of Bass. END
BEGIN NOW See? END
BEGIN NOW It all works out. END
BEGIN NOW A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him END
BEGIN NOW along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. END
BEGIN NOW Bargains. END
BEGIN NOW Like END
BEGIN NOW that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW L. END
BEGIN NOW Y. END
BEGIN NOW S. END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom Hely's. END
BEGIN NOW Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his END

BEGIN NOW Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after END
BEGIN NOW street. END
BEGIN NOW Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. END
BEGIN NOW They are not END
BEGIN NOW Boyl: no, M Glade's men. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't bring in any business either. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls END

BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW bet that would have caught on. END
BEGIN NOW Smart girls writing something catch the END

BEGIN NOW Get twenty of END

BEGIN NOW Have a finger in the pie. END
BEGIN NOW Women END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Curiosity. END
BEGIN NOW Pillar of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't have it of course because he END

BEGIN NOW Or the inkbottle I suggested with a END

BEGIN NOW His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted END
BEGIN NOW under the obituaries, cold meat department. END
BEGIN NOW You can't lick 'em. END

BEGIN NOW Turn up like a bad penny. END

BEGIN NOW Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle... END

BEGIN NOW Pleasure or pain is it? END
BEGIN NOW Penny dinner. END

BEGIN NOW She took back the card, sighing. END
BEGIN NOW —And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. END
BEGIN NOW He's going to take an END

BEGIN NOW She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch. END
BEGIN NOW Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. END
BEGIN NOW Seen its END
BEGIN NOW best days. END
BEGIN NOW Wispish hair over her ears. END
BEGIN NOW And that dowdy toque: three old END

BEGIN NOW Shabby genteel. END
BEGIN NOW She used to be a END
BEGIN NOW tasty dresser. END
BEGIN NOW Lines round her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Only a year or so older than END

BEGIN NOW See the eye that woman gave her, passing. END
BEGIN NOW Cruel. END
BEGIN NOW The unfair sex. END
BEGIN NOW He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. END
BEGIN NOW Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. END
BEGIN NOW I'm hungry too. END
BEGIN NOW Flakes of pastry END
BEGIN NOW on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. END

BEGIN NOW In Luke Doyle's long ago. END
BEGIN NOW Dolphin's Barn, the charades. END

BEGIN NOW She's three days bad END
BEGIN NOW now. END
BEGIN NOW —O, Mr Bloom said. END

BEGIN NOW It's a very stiff END

BEGIN NOW —-O, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. END
BEGIN NOW His tongue clacked in END

BEGIN NOW Dth! END
BEGIN NOW Dth! END
BEGIN NOW —I'm sorry to hear that, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Poor thing! END
BEGIN NOW Three days! END
BEGIN NOW That's END

BEGIN NOW Mrs Breen nodded. END
BEGIN NOW —She was taken bad on the Tuesday... END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: END
BEGIN NOW —Mind! END
BEGIN NOW Let this man pass. END
BEGIN NOW A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a END
BEGIN NOW rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. END
BEGIN NOW Tight as a END
BEGIN NOW skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. END
BEGIN NOW From his arm a folded dustcoat, END
BEGIN NOW a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride. END
BEGIN NOW —Watch him, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He always walks outside the lampposts. END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW —Who is he if it's a fair question? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Breen asked. END
BEGIN NOW Is he dotty? END
BEGIN NOW —His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom END

BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW —He has enough of them, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Denis will be like that one of these END

BEGIN NOW —There he is, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I must go after him. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye. END
BEGIN NOW Remember me to END
BEGIN NOW Molly, won't you? END
BEGIN NOW —I will, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. END
BEGIN NOW Denis Breen END
BEGIN NOW in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's END
BEGIN NOW hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. END
BEGIN NOW Blown in from the bay. END
BEGIN NOW Like old END

BEGIN NOW earnestly. END
BEGIN NOW Meshuggah. END
BEGIN NOW Off his chump. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the END

BEGIN NOW Watch him! END
BEGIN NOW Out he goes again. END

BEGIN NOW When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: END
BEGIN NOW —What is this he is? END
BEGIN NOW Isn't he in the insurance line? END
BEGIN NOW —He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW He does canvassing for the END
BEGIN NOW Freeman. END
BEGIN NOW —I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Is he in trouble? END
BEGIN NOW —Trouble? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Not that I heard of. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW —I noticed he was in mourning. END
BEGIN NOW —Was he? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW So he was, faith. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him how was all at END
BEGIN NOW home. END
BEGIN NOW You're right, by God. END
BEGIN NOW So he was. END
BEGIN NOW —I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a END
BEGIN NOW gentleman is in trouble that way. END
BEGIN NOW It only brings it up fresh in their END
BEGIN NOW minds. END
BEGIN NOW —It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW I met him the day before END
BEGIN NOW yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's END
BEGIN NOW wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home END
BEGIN NOW to his better half. END
BEGIN NOW She's well nourished, I tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Plovers on toast. END
BEGIN NOW —And is he doing for the Freeman? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn pursed his lips. END
BEGIN NOW —-He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. END
BEGIN NOW You can make bacon of END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW —How so? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book. END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW winked. END
BEGIN NOW —He's in the craft, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —-Do you tell me so? END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW —Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Ancient free and accepted order. END
BEGIN NOW He's END
BEGIN NOW an excellent brother. END
BEGIN NOW Light, life and love, by God. END
BEGIN NOW They give him a leg END
BEGIN NOW up. END
BEGIN NOW I was told that by a—well, I won't say who. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW —O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW They stick to you when you're END
BEGIN NOW down. END
BEGIN NOW I know a fellow was trying to get into it. END
BEGIN NOW But they're as close as END
BEGIN NOW damn it. END
BEGIN NOW By God they did right to keep the women out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: END
BEGIN NOW —Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! END
BEGIN NOW —There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find END
BEGIN NOW out what they do be doing. END
BEGIN NOW But be damned but they smelt her out and END
BEGIN NOW swore her in on the spot a master mason. END
BEGIN NOW That was one of the saint END
BEGIN NOW Legers of Doneraile. END
BEGIN NOW Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: END
BEGIN NOW —And is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Decent quiet man he is. END
BEGIN NOW I often saw him in here and END
BEGIN NOW I never once saw him—you know, over the line. END
BEGIN NOW —God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. END
BEGIN NOW Slips END
BEGIN NOW off when the fun gets too hot. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't you see him look at his watch? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, END
BEGIN NOW you weren't there. END
BEGIN NOW If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he END
BEGIN NOW outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to God he END
BEGIN NOW does. END
BEGIN NOW —There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW He's a safe man, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW —He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. END
BEGIN NOW He's been known to END
BEGIN NOW put his hand down too to help a fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Give the devil his due. END
BEGIN NOW O, Bloom END
BEGIN NOW has his good points. END
BEGIN NOW But there's one thing he'll never do. END
BEGIN NOW His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog. END
BEGIN NOW —I know, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW —Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford followed frowning, END
BEGIN NOW a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW —Day, Mr Byrne. END
BEGIN NOW —Day, gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW They paused at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW —Who's standing? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, what'll it be? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said. END
BEGIN NOW —How much? END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard cried. END
BEGIN NOW Since when, for God' sake? END
BEGIN NOW What's yours, END
BEGIN NOW Tom? END
BEGIN NOW —How is the main drainage? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn asked, sipping. END
BEGIN NOW For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and END
BEGIN NOW hiccupped. END
BEGIN NOW —Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Certainly, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates. END
BEGIN NOW —Lord love a duck, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Look at what I'm standing drinks to! END
BEGIN NOW Cold END
BEGIN NOW water and gingerpop! END
BEGIN NOW Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. END
BEGIN NOW He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. END
BEGIN NOW A dead snip. END
BEGIN NOW —Zinfandel is it? END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn asked. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW —That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking. END
BEGIN NOW —Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford nodded and drank. END
BEGIN NOW —Is it Zinfandel? END
BEGIN NOW —Say nothing! END
BEGIN NOW Bantam Lyons winked. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to plunge five bob on my END
BEGIN NOW own. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard END
BEGIN NOW said. END
BEGIN NOW Who gave it to you? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting. END
BEGIN NOW —So long! END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn said. END
BEGIN NOW The others turned. END
BEGIN NOW —That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered. END
BEGIN NOW —Prrwht! END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Leonard said with scorn. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two of END
BEGIN NOW your small Jamesons after that and a... END
BEGIN NOW —Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, Paddy Leonard said. END
BEGIN NOW A suckingbottle for the baby. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth END
BEGIN NOW smooth. END
BEGIN NOW Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. END
BEGIN NOW Then with END
BEGIN NOW those Rontgen rays searchlight you could. END
BEGIN NOW At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the END
BEGIN NOW cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. END
BEGIN NOW Surfeit. END
BEGIN NOW Returned with thanks END
BEGIN NOW having fully digested the contents. END
BEGIN NOW First sweet then savoury. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom END
BEGIN NOW coasted warily. END
BEGIN NOW Ruminants. END
BEGIN NOW His second course. END
BEGIN NOW Their upper jaw they move. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? END
BEGIN NOW Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Lean people long mouths. END
BEGIN NOW Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent END
BEGIN NOW free. END
BEGIN NOW Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering. END
BEGIN NOW He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: END
BEGIN NOW Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti. END
BEGIN NOW Feel better. END
BEGIN NOW Burgundy. END
BEGIN NOW Good pick me up. END
BEGIN NOW Who distilled first? END
BEGIN NOW Some chap END
BEGIN NOW in the blues. END
BEGIN NOW Dutch courage. END
BEGIN NOW That Kilkenny People in the national END
BEGIN NOW library now I must. END
BEGIN NOW Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, END

BEGIN NOW But the poor buffer would have to stand all the END

BEGIN NOW Tonight perhaps. END

BEGIN NOW Brighton, END

BEGIN NOW Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy END
BEGIN NOW thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. END
BEGIN NOW Handy man wants job. END
BEGIN NOW Small wages. END
BEGIN NOW Will eat anything. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and END
BEGIN NOW passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. END
BEGIN NOW Why I left the church END
BEGIN NOW of Rome? END
BEGIN NOW Birds' Nest. END
BEGIN NOW Women run him. END
BEGIN NOW They say they used to give pauper END
BEGIN NOW children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. END
BEGIN NOW Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. END
BEGIN NOW Same END
BEGIN NOW bait. END
BEGIN NOW Why we left the church of Rome. END
BEGIN NOW A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. END
BEGIN NOW No END
BEGIN NOW tram in sight. END
BEGIN NOW Wants to cross. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you want to cross? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling did not answer. END
BEGIN NOW His wallface frowned weakly. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW moved his head uncertainly. END
BEGIN NOW —You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW Molesworth street is opposite. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to cross? END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing in the way. END
BEGIN NOW The cane moved out trembling to the left. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's eye followed its END
BEGIN NOW line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. END
BEGIN NOW Where I END
BEGIN NOW saw his brillantined hair just when I was. END
BEGIN NOW Horse drooping. END
BEGIN NOW Driver in END
BEGIN NOW John Long's. END
BEGIN NOW Slaking his drouth. END
BEGIN NOW —There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. END
BEGIN NOW I'll see you END
BEGIN NOW across. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to go to Molesworth street? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, the stripling answered. END
BEGIN NOW South Frederick street. END
BEGIN NOW —Come, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to END
BEGIN NOW guide it forward. END
BEGIN NOW Say something to him. END
BEGIN NOW Better not do the condescending. END
BEGIN NOW They mistrust END
BEGIN NOW what you tell them. END
BEGIN NOW Pass a common remark. END
BEGIN NOW —The rain kept off. END
BEGIN NOW No answer. END
BEGIN NOW Stains on his coat. END
BEGIN NOW Slobbers his food, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Tastes all different END
BEGIN NOW for him. END
BEGIN NOW Have to be spoonfed first. END
BEGIN NOW Like a child's hand, his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Like END
BEGIN NOW Milly's was. END
BEGIN NOW Sensitive. END
BEGIN NOW Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if END
BEGIN NOW he has a name. END
BEGIN NOW Van. END
BEGIN NOW Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired END
BEGIN NOW drudge get his doze. END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW Clear. END
BEGIN NOW Behind a bull: in front of a END
BEGIN NOW horse. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanks, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Knows I'm a man. END
BEGIN NOW Voice. END
BEGIN NOW —Right now? END
BEGIN NOW First turn to the left. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing END
BEGIN NOW his cane back, feeling again. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone END
BEGIN NOW tweed. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young fellow! END
BEGIN NOW How on earth did he know that van was there? END
BEGIN NOW Must have felt it. END
BEGIN NOW See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense END
BEGIN NOW of volume. END
BEGIN NOW Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder END
BEGIN NOW would he feel it if something was removed. END
BEGIN NOW Feel a gap. END
BEGIN NOW Queer idea of END
BEGIN NOW Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. END
BEGIN NOW Could he walk END
BEGIN NOW in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? END
BEGIN NOW Bloodless pious face like a fellow END
BEGIN NOW going in to be a priest. END
BEGIN NOW Penrose! END
BEGIN NOW That was that chap's name. END
BEGIN NOW Look at all the things they can learn to do. END
BEGIN NOW Read with their fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Tune pianos. END
BEGIN NOW Or we are surprised they have any brains. END
BEGIN NOW Why we think a END
BEGIN NOW deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. END
BEGIN NOW Of course the other senses are more. END
BEGIN NOW Embroider. END
BEGIN NOW Plait baskets. END
BEGIN NOW People END
BEGIN NOW ought to help. END
BEGIN NOW Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. END
BEGIN NOW Hates END
BEGIN NOW sewing. END
BEGIN NOW Might take an objection. END
BEGIN NOW Dark men they call them. END
BEGIN NOW Sense of smell must be stronger too. END
BEGIN NOW Smells on all sides, bunched END
BEGIN NOW together. END
BEGIN NOW Each street different smell. END
BEGIN NOW Each person too. END
BEGIN NOW Then the spring, END
BEGIN NOW the summer: smells. END
BEGIN NOW Tastes? END
BEGIN NOW They say you can't taste wines with your END
BEGIN NOW eyes shut or a cold in the head. END
BEGIN NOW Also smoke in the dark they say get no END
BEGIN NOW pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW And with a woman, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW More shameless not seeing. END
BEGIN NOW That girl END
BEGIN NOW passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Look at me. END
BEGIN NOW I have END
BEGIN NOW them all on. END
BEGIN NOW Must be strange not to see her. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a form in his END
BEGIN NOW mind's eye. END
BEGIN NOW The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his END
BEGIN NOW fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. END
BEGIN NOW His hands on her hair, END
BEGIN NOW for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Say it was black, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW We call it black. END
BEGIN NOW Then passing over her white skin. END
BEGIN NOW Different feel perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Feeling of END
BEGIN NOW white. END
BEGIN NOW Postoffice. END
BEGIN NOW Must answer. END
BEGIN NOW Fag today. END
BEGIN NOW Send her a postal order two END
BEGIN NOW shillings, half a crown. END
BEGIN NOW Accept my little present. END
BEGIN NOW Stationer's just here END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Think over it. END
BEGIN NOW With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above END
BEGIN NOW his ears. END
BEGIN NOW Again. END
BEGIN NOW Fibres of fine fine straw. END
BEGIN NOW Then gently his finger felt END
BEGIN NOW the skin of his right cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Downy hair there too. END
BEGIN NOW Not smooth enough. END
BEGIN NOW The belly is the smoothest. END
BEGIN NOW No-one about. END
BEGIN NOW There he goes into Frederick END
BEGIN NOW street. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. END
BEGIN NOW Might be settling END
BEGIN NOW my braces. END
BEGIN NOW Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat END
BEGIN NOW and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of END
BEGIN NOW his belly. END
BEGIN NOW But I know it's whitey yellow. END
BEGIN NOW Want to try in the dark to END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to. END
BEGIN NOW Poor fellow! END
BEGIN NOW Quite a boy. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible. END
BEGIN NOW Really terrible. END
BEGIN NOW What dreams would END
BEGIN NOW he have, not seeing? END
BEGIN NOW Life a dream for him. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the justice being END

BEGIN NOW It's so French. END
BEGIN NOW The French point END
BEGIN NOW of view. END
BEGIN NOW Hamlet ou... END
BEGIN NOW —The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton laughed. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent people, no doubt, but END
BEGIN NOW distressingly shortsighted in some matters. END
BEGIN NOW Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder. END
BEGIN NOW —A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Not for END

BEGIN NOW Nine lives are taken off for his father's one. END

BEGIN NOW List! END
BEGIN NOW List! END
BEGIN NOW O List! END
BEGIN NOW My flesh hears him: creeping, hears. END
BEGIN NOW If thou didst ever... END
BEGIN NOW —What is a ghost? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said with tingling energy. END
BEGIN NOW One who has faded END
BEGIN NOW into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of END
BEGIN NOW manners. END
BEGIN NOW Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris END
BEGIN NOW lies from virgin Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning END
BEGIN NOW to the world that has forgotten him? END
BEGIN NOW Who is King Hamlet? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge. END
BEGIN NOW Lifted. END
BEGIN NOW —It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a END

BEGIN NOW But he does not stay to feed the pen END
BEGIN NOW chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. END
BEGIN NOW The swan of Avon has END

BEGIN NOW Composition of place. END
BEGIN NOW Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me! END
BEGIN NOW —The play begins. END
BEGIN NOW A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the END
BEGIN NOW castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. END
BEGIN NOW It is the END
BEGIN NOW ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who END
BEGIN NOW has studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in END
BEGIN NOW order to play the part of the spectre. END
BEGIN NOW He speaks the words to Burbage, END
BEGIN NOW the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, END
BEGIN NOW calling him by a name: END
BEGIN NOW Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit, END
BEGIN NOW bidding him list. END
BEGIN NOW To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, END
BEGIN NOW young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has END
BEGIN NOW died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever. END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in END
BEGIN NOW the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words END
BEGIN NOW to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been END
BEGIN NOW prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that END
BEGIN NOW he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you END
BEGIN NOW are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the END
BEGIN NOW guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway? END
BEGIN NOW —But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began END
BEGIN NOW impatiently. END
BEGIN NOW Art thou there, truepenny? END
BEGIN NOW —Interesting only to the parish clerk. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, we have the plays. END
BEGIN NOW I mean END
BEGIN NOW when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet END

BEGIN NOW As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l'Isle END

BEGIN NOW —Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton's carping voice asked. END
BEGIN NOW Her ghost at least has been laid END
BEGIN NOW for ever. END
BEGIN NOW She died, for literature at least, before she was born. END
BEGIN NOW —She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW saw him into and out of the world. END
BEGIN NOW She took his first embraces. END
BEGIN NOW She bore END
BEGIN NOW his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed END
BEGIN NOW when he lay on his deathbed. END
BEGIN NOW Mother's deathbed. END
BEGIN NOW Candle. END
BEGIN NOW The sheeted mirror. END
BEGIN NOW Who brought me into this END

BEGIN NOW Liliata END
BEGIN NOW rutilantium. END
BEGIN NOW I wept alone. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp. END
BEGIN NOW —The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got END
BEGIN NOW out of it as quickly and as best he could. END
BEGIN NOW —Bosh! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said rudely. END
BEGIN NOW A man of genius makes no mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery. END
BEGIN NOW Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, END
BEGIN NOW softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous. END
BEGIN NOW —A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of END
BEGIN NOW discovery, one should imagine. END
BEGIN NOW What useful discovery did Socrates learn END
BEGIN NOW from Xanthippe? END
BEGIN NOW —Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts END
BEGIN NOW into the world. END
BEGIN NOW What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!), END
BEGIN NOW Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the END
BEGIN NOW archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock. END
BEGIN NOW —But Ann Hathaway? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, we seem END
BEGIN NOW to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her. END
BEGIN NOW His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to END
BEGIN NOW chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless END
BEGIN NOW though maligned. END
BEGIN NOW —He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. END
BEGIN NOW He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling END
BEGIN NOW The girl I left behind me. END
BEGIN NOW If the earthquake did not time it we should END
BEGIN NOW know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, END
BEGIN NOW the studded bridle and her blue windows. END

BEGIN NOW Good: he left her and gained the world of END

BEGIN NOW But his boywomen are the women of a boy. END
BEGIN NOW Their life, thought, END

BEGIN NOW He chose badly? END
BEGIN NOW He was chosen, it seems END

BEGIN NOW When? END
BEGIN NOW Come! END
BEGIN NOW —Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, END
BEGIN NOW brightly. END
BEGIN NOW He murmured then with blond delight for all: END
BEGIN NOW Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie. END
BEGIN NOW Paris: the wellpleased pleaser. END
BEGIN NOW A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its END

BEGIN NOW —I am afraid I am due at the Homestead. END
BEGIN NOW Whither away? END
BEGIN NOW Exploitable ground. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you going? END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. END
BEGIN NOW Shall we see you END
BEGIN NOW at Moore's tonight? END
BEGIN NOW Piper is coming. END
BEGIN NOW —Piper! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best piped. END
BEGIN NOW Is Piper back? END
BEGIN NOW Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper. END

BEGIN NOW friendly and earnest. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a END

BEGIN NOW We are all looking forward END
BEGIN NOW anxiously. END
BEGIN NOW Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, END
BEGIN NOW lighted, shone. END
BEGIN NOW See this. END
BEGIN NOW Remember. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his END

BEGIN NOW Young Colum and Starkey. END
BEGIN NOW George Roberts is doing the commercial part. END
BEGIN NOW Longworth will give it a good puff in the Express. END
BEGIN NOW O, will he? END
BEGIN NOW I liked END

BEGIN NOW Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. END
BEGIN NOW Do you END

BEGIN NOW Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a END

BEGIN NOW I hope you'll be able to come tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Malachi END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan is coming too. END
BEGIN NOW Moore asked him to bring Haines. END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear END
BEGIN NOW Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? END
BEGIN NOW That Moore is Martyn's wild END
BEGIN NOW oats? END
BEGIN NOW Awfully clever, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW They remind one of Don Quixote and END
BEGIN NOW Sancho Panza. END
BEGIN NOW Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. END
BEGIN NOW Moore is the man for it. END
BEGIN NOW A knight of the rueful countenance here in END

BEGIN NOW —Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. END
BEGIN NOW If you will be END

BEGIN NOW —O, yes. END
BEGIN NOW If he considers it important it will go in. END
BEGIN NOW We have so much END

BEGIN NOW Bring Starkey. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen sat down. END
BEGIN NOW The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. END
BEGIN NOW Blushing, his mask said: END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating. END
BEGIN NOW He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a END
BEGIN NOW chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: END
BEGIN NOW —Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet? END
BEGIN NOW Alarmed face asks me. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he come? END
BEGIN NOW Courtesy or an inward light? END
BEGIN NOW —Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been END
BEGIN NOW first a sundering. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, END
BEGIN NOW from hue and cry. END

BEGIN NOW So you think... END
BEGIN NOW The door closed behind the outgoer. END
BEGIN NOW Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and END
BEGIN NOW brooding air. END
BEGIN NOW A vestal's lamp. END
BEGIN NOW Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do END
BEGIN NOW had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of END
BEGIN NOW the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when END
BEGIN NOW he lived among women. END
BEGIN NOW Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words. END
BEGIN NOW Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. END
BEGIN NOW And I heard the voice END
BEGIN NOW of that Egyptian highpriest. END
BEGIN NOW In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks. END
BEGIN NOW They are still. END
BEGIN NOW Once quick in the brains of men. END
BEGIN NOW Still: but an itch of END
BEGIN NOW death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak END
BEGIN NOW their will. END
BEGIN NOW —Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most END
BEGIN NOW enigmatic. END
BEGIN NOW We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. END
BEGIN NOW Not even so END
BEGIN NOW much. END
BEGIN NOW Others abide our question. END
BEGIN NOW A shadow hangs over all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW —But Hamlet is so personal, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best pleaded. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, a kind of END
BEGIN NOW private paper, don't you know, of his private life. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don't care END
BEGIN NOW a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty... END
BEGIN NOW He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his END
BEGIN NOW defiance. END
BEGIN NOW His private papers in the original. END
BEGIN NOW Ta an bad ar an tir. END
BEGIN NOW Taim END
BEGIN NOW in mo shagart. END
BEGIN NOW Put beurla on it, littlejohn. END
BEGIN NOW Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: END
BEGIN NOW —I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I END
BEGIN NOW may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. END
BEGIN NOW Bear with me. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under END
BEGIN NOW wrinkled brows. END
BEGIN NOW A basilisk. END
BEGIN NOW E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca. END
BEGIN NOW Messer END
BEGIN NOW Brunetto, I thank thee for the word. END
BEGIN NOW —As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from END
BEGIN NOW day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist END
BEGIN NOW weave and unweave his image. END
BEGIN NOW And as the mole on my right breast is where END
BEGIN NOW it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff END
BEGIN NOW time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of END
BEGIN NOW the unliving son looks forth. END
BEGIN NOW In the intense instant of imagination, END
BEGIN NOW when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that END
BEGIN NOW which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. END
BEGIN NOW So in the END
BEGIN NOW future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but END
BEGIN NOW by reflection from that which then I shall be. END
BEGIN NOW Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mr Best said youngly. END
BEGIN NOW I feel Hamlet quite young. END
BEGIN NOW The bitterness END
BEGIN NOW might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from END
BEGIN NOW the son. END
BEGIN NOW Has the wrong sow by the lug. END
BEGIN NOW He is in my father. END
BEGIN NOW I am in his son. END
BEGIN NOW —That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow. END
BEGIN NOW —If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug END
BEGIN NOW in the market. END
BEGIN NOW The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan END
BEGIN NOW admired so much breathe another spirit. END
BEGIN NOW —The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed. END
BEGIN NOW —There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a END
BEGIN NOW sundering. END
BEGIN NOW Said that. END
BEGIN NOW —If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over END
BEGIN NOW the hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, END
BEGIN NOW look to see when and how the shadow lifts. END
BEGIN NOW What softens the heart of a END
BEGIN NOW man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, END
BEGIN NOW prince of Tyre? END
BEGIN NOW Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded. END
BEGIN NOW —A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina. END
BEGIN NOW —The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant END
BEGIN NOW quantity, John Eglinton detected. END
BEGIN NOW The highroads are dreary but they lead END
BEGIN NOW to the town. END
BEGIN NOW Good Bacon: gone musty. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. END
BEGIN NOW Cypherjugglers END
BEGIN NOW going the highroads. END
BEGIN NOW Seekers on the great quest. END
BEGIN NOW What town, good END
BEGIN NOW masters? END
BEGIN NOW Mummed in names: A. END
BEGIN NOW E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. END
BEGIN NOW East of the END
BEGIN NOW sun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. END
BEGIN NOW Booted the twain and staved. END
BEGIN NOW How many miles to Dublin? END
BEGIN NOW Three score and ten, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Will we be there by END
BEGIN NOW candlelight? END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing END
BEGIN NOW period. END
BEGIN NOW —Does he? END
BEGIN NOW What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his END
BEGIN NOW name is, say of it? END
BEGIN NOW —Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, END
BEGIN NOW that which was lost. END
BEGIN NOW What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's END
BEGIN NOW child. END
BEGIN NOW My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. END
BEGIN NOW Will any man END
BEGIN NOW love the daughter if he has not loved the mother? END
BEGIN NOW —The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. END
BEGIN NOW l'art d'Ãªtre END
BEGIN NOW grand... END
BEGIN NOW —Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, END
BEGIN NOW another image? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what you are talking about? END
BEGIN NOW Love, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Word known to all END
BEGIN NOW men. END
BEGIN NOW Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW —His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of END
BEGIN NOW all experience, material and moral. END
BEGIN NOW Such an appeal will touch him. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW images of other males of his blood will repel him. END
BEGIN NOW He will see in them END
BEGIN NOW grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself. END
BEGIN NOW The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope. END
BEGIN NOW —I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the END
BEGIN NOW public. END
BEGIN NOW And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George END
BEGIN NOW Bernard Shaw. END
BEGIN NOW Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. END
BEGIN NOW His articles on END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. END
BEGIN NOW Oddly enough END
BEGIN NOW he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the END
BEGIN NOW sonnets. END
BEGIN NOW The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. END
BEGIN NOW I own END
BEGIN NOW that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in END
BEGIN NOW harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have END
BEGIN NOW been. END
BEGIN NOW Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize END
BEGIN NOW of their fray. END
BEGIN NOW He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. END
BEGIN NOW Dost love, Miriam? END
BEGIN NOW Dost END
BEGIN NOW love thy man? END
BEGIN NOW —That may be too, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr END
BEGIN NOW Magee likes to quote. END
BEGIN NOW Beware of what you wish for in youth because you END
BEGIN NOW will get it in middle life. END
BEGIN NOW Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, END
BEGIN NOW a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a END
BEGIN NOW lordling to woo for him? END
BEGIN NOW He was himself a lord of language and had made END
BEGIN NOW himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Belief in himself has been untimely killed. END
BEGIN NOW He was overborne in a END
BEGIN NOW cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor END
BEGIN NOW in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie END
BEGIN NOW down. END
BEGIN NOW Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. END
BEGIN NOW No later undoing will END
BEGIN NOW undo the first undoing. END
BEGIN NOW The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where END
BEGIN NOW love lies ableeding. END
BEGIN NOW If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her END
BEGIN NOW woman's invisible weapon. END
BEGIN NOW There is, I feel in the words, some goad of END
BEGIN NOW the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, END
BEGIN NOW darkening even his own understanding of himself. END
BEGIN NOW A like fate awaits him END
BEGIN NOW and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool. END
BEGIN NOW They list. END
BEGIN NOW And in the porches of their ears I pour. END
BEGIN NOW —The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the END
BEGIN NOW porch of a sleeping ear. END
BEGIN NOW But those who are done to death in sleep cannot END
BEGIN NOW know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls END
BEGIN NOW with that knowledge in the life to come. END
BEGIN NOW The poisoning and the beast END
BEGIN NOW with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were END
BEGIN NOW he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. END
BEGIN NOW That is why the speech END
BEGIN NOW (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. END
BEGIN NOW Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from END
BEGIN NOW Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its END
BEGIN NOW mole cinquespotted. END
BEGIN NOW He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up END
BEGIN NOW to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. END
BEGIN NOW But, because END
BEGIN NOW loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished END
BEGIN NOW personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has END
BEGIN NOW revealed. END
BEGIN NOW His beaver is up. END
BEGIN NOW He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by END
BEGIN NOW Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard only END
BEGIN NOW in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son END
BEGIN NOW consubstantial with the father. END
BEGIN NOW —Amen! END
BEGIN NOW was responded from the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? END
BEGIN NOW Entr'acte. END
BEGIN NOW A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then END
BEGIN NOW blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. END
BEGIN NOW My telegram. END
BEGIN NOW —You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? END
BEGIN NOW he asked END
BEGIN NOW of Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble. END
BEGIN NOW They make him welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen. END
BEGIN NOW Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most. END
BEGIN NOW He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, END
BEGIN NOW Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, END
BEGIN NOW stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on END
BEGIN NOW crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven END
BEGIN NOW and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His END
BEGIN NOW Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead END
BEGIN NOW when all the quick shall be dead already. END
BEGIN NOW Glo—o—ri—a in ex—cel—sis De—o. END
BEGIN NOW He lifts his hands. END
BEGIN NOW Veils fall. END
BEGIN NOW O, flowers! END
BEGIN NOW Bells with bells with bells END
BEGIN NOW aquiring. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. END
BEGIN NOW A most instructive discussion. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW All sides of life should be represented. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled on all sides equally. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: END
BEGIN NOW —Shakespeare? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW I seem to know the name. END
BEGIN NOW A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features. END
BEGIN NOW —To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. END
BEGIN NOW The chap that writes like END
BEGIN NOW Synge. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best turned to him. END
BEGIN NOW —Haines missed you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Did you meet him? END
BEGIN NOW He'll see you after at END
BEGIN NOW the D. END
BEGIN NOW B. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht. END
BEGIN NOW —I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW Was he here? END
BEGIN NOW —The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired END
BEGIN NOW perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. END
BEGIN NOW I hear that an actress played END
BEGIN NOW Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Vining END
BEGIN NOW held that the prince was a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Has no-one made him out to be an END
BEGIN NOW Irishman? END
BEGIN NOW Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick. END
BEGIN NOW —The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said, END
BEGIN NOW lifting his brilliant notebook. END
BEGIN NOW That Portrait of Mr W. END
BEGIN NOW H. END
BEGIN NOW where he END
BEGIN NOW proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues. END
BEGIN NOW —For Willie Hughes, is it not? END
BEGIN NOW the quaker librarian asked. END
BEGIN NOW Or Hughie Wills? END
BEGIN NOW Mr William Himself. END
BEGIN NOW W. END
BEGIN NOW H.: who am I? END
BEGIN NOW —I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. END
BEGIN NOW Of END
BEGIN NOW course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the END
BEGIN NOW colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. END
BEGIN NOW It's the very END
BEGIN NOW essence of Wilde, don't you know. END
BEGIN NOW The light touch. END
BEGIN NOW His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. END
BEGIN NOW Tame essence of Wilde. END
BEGIN NOW You're darned witty. END
BEGIN NOW Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan END
BEGIN NOW Deasy's ducats. END
BEGIN NOW How much did I spend? END
BEGIN NOW O, a few shillings. END
BEGIN NOW For a plump of pressmen. END
BEGIN NOW Humour wet and dry. END
BEGIN NOW Wit. END
BEGIN NOW You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks END
BEGIN NOW in. END
BEGIN NOW Lineaments of gratified desire. END
BEGIN NOW There be many mo. END
BEGIN NOW Take her for me. END
BEGIN NOW In pairing time. END
BEGIN NOW Jove, a cool ruttime END
BEGIN NOW send them. END
BEGIN NOW Yea, turtledove her. END
BEGIN NOW Eve. END
BEGIN NOW Naked wheatbellied sin. END
BEGIN NOW A snake coils her, fang in's kiss. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you think it is only a paradox? END
BEGIN NOW the quaker librarian was asking. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious. END
BEGIN NOW They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Then, his head END
BEGIN NOW wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW mobile lips read, smiling with new delight. END
BEGIN NOW —Telegram! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful inspiration! END
BEGIN NOW Telegram! END
BEGIN NOW A papal bull! END
BEGIN NOW He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: END
BEGIN NOW —The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense END
BEGIN NOW debtorship for a thing done. END
BEGIN NOW Signed: Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you launch it END
BEGIN NOW from? END
BEGIN NOW The kips? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW College Green. END
BEGIN NOW Have you drunk the four quid? END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. END
BEGIN NOW Telegram! END
BEGIN NOW Malachi END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. END
BEGIN NOW O, you peerless mummer! END
BEGIN NOW O, you END
BEGIN NOW priestified Kinchite! END
BEGIN NOW Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a END
BEGIN NOW querulous brogue: END
BEGIN NOW —It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were, END
BEGIN NOW Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas murmur we did END
BEGIN NOW for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with END
BEGIN NOW leching. END
BEGIN NOW And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's END
BEGIN NOW sitting civil waiting for pints apiece. END
BEGIN NOW He wailed: END
BEGIN NOW —And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your END
BEGIN NOW conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the END
BEGIN NOW drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down. END
BEGIN NOW —The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. END
BEGIN NOW He heard END
BEGIN NOW you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. END
BEGIN NOW He's out in pampooties to END
BEGIN NOW murder you. END
BEGIN NOW —Me! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW That was your contribution to literature. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping END
BEGIN NOW ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW —Murder you! END
BEGIN NOW he laughed. END
BEGIN NOW Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of END
BEGIN NOW lights in rue Saint-AndrÃ©-des-Arts. END
BEGIN NOW In words of words for words, END
BEGIN NOW palabras. END
BEGIN NOW Oisin with Patrick. END
BEGIN NOW Faunman he met in Clamart woods, END
BEGIN NOW brandishing a winebottle. END
BEGIN NOW C'est vendredi saint! END
BEGIN NOW Murthering Irish. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW image, wandering, he met. END
BEGIN NOW I mine. END
BEGIN NOW I met a fool i'the forest. END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar. END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW in which everyone can find his own. END
BEGIN NOW So Mr Justice Madden in his END
BEGIN NOW Diary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... END
BEGIN NOW Yes? END
BEGIN NOW What END
BEGIN NOW is it? END
BEGIN NOW —There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and END
BEGIN NOW offering a card. END
BEGIN NOW From the Freeman. END
BEGIN NOW He wants to see the files of the END
BEGIN NOW Kilkenny People for last year. END
BEGIN NOW —Certainly, certainly, certainly. END
BEGIN NOW Is the gentleman?... END
BEGIN NOW He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, END
BEGIN NOW asked, creaked, asked: END
BEGIN NOW —Is he?... END
BEGIN NOW O, there! END
BEGIN NOW Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. END
BEGIN NOW In the daylit corridor he talked END
BEGIN NOW with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most END
BEGIN NOW honest broadbrim. END
BEGIN NOW —This gentleman? END
BEGIN NOW Freeman's Journal? END
BEGIN NOW Kilkenny People? END
BEGIN NOW To be sure. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW day, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Kilkenny... END
BEGIN NOW We have certainly... END
BEGIN NOW A patient silhouette waited, listening. END
BEGIN NOW —All the leading provincial... END
BEGIN NOW Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy END
BEGIN NOW Guardian, 1903... END
BEGIN NOW Will you please?... END
BEGIN NOW Evans, conduct this gentleman... END
BEGIN NOW If you just follow the atten... END
BEGIN NOW Or, please allow me... END
BEGIN NOW This way... END
BEGIN NOW Please, sir... END
BEGIN NOW Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing END
BEGIN NOW dark figure following his hasty heels. END
BEGIN NOW The door closed. END
BEGIN NOW —The sheeny! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW He jumped up and snatched the card. END
BEGIN NOW —What's his name? END
BEGIN NOW Ikey Moses? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW He rattled on: END
BEGIN NOW —Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. END
BEGIN NOW I found him over in the END
BEGIN NOW museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. END
BEGIN NOW The Greek mouth that END
BEGIN NOW has never been twisted in prayer. END
BEGIN NOW Every day we must do homage to her. END
BEGIN NOW Life of life, thy lips enkindle. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly he turned to Stephen: END
BEGIN NOW —He knows you. END
BEGIN NOW He knows your old fellow. END
BEGIN NOW O, I fear me, he is Greeker END
BEGIN NOW than the Greeks. END
BEGIN NOW His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. END
BEGIN NOW Venus Kallipyge. END
BEGIN NOW O, the thunder of those loins! END
BEGIN NOW The god pursuing the END
BEGIN NOW maiden hid. END
BEGIN NOW —We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW begin to be interested in Mrs S. END
BEGIN NOW Till now we had thought of her, if at END
BEGIN NOW all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome. END
BEGIN NOW —Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty END
BEGIN NOW from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in END
BEGIN NOW whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty END
BEGIN NOW years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary END
BEGIN NOW equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW His life was rich. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the END
BEGIN NOW art of surfeit. END
BEGIN NOW Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar END
BEGIN NOW of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Walter END
BEGIN NOW Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back END
BEGIN NOW including a pair of fancy stays. END
BEGIN NOW The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had END
BEGIN NOW underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty years he dallied END
BEGIN NOW there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love END
BEGIN NOW and its foul pleasures. END
BEGIN NOW You know Manningham's story of the burgher's END
BEGIN NOW wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard END
BEGIN NOW III and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, END
BEGIN NOW took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, END
BEGIN NOW answered from the capon's blankets: William the conqueror came before END
BEGIN NOW Richard III. END
BEGIN NOW And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and END
BEGIN NOW his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is END
BEGIN NOW suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time. END
BEGIN NOW Cours la Reine. END
BEGIN NOW Encore vingt sous. END
BEGIN NOW Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. END
BEGIN NOW Minette? END
BEGIN NOW Tu veux? END
BEGIN NOW —The height of fine society. END
BEGIN NOW And sir William Davenant of oxford's mother END
BEGIN NOW with her cup of canary for any cockcanary. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: END
BEGIN NOW —Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! END
BEGIN NOW —And Harry of six wives' daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And other lady friends from neighbour END
BEGIN NOW seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. END
BEGIN NOW But all those twenty END
BEGIN NOW years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind END
BEGIN NOW the diamond panes? END
BEGIN NOW Do and do. END
BEGIN NOW Thing done. END
BEGIN NOW In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, END
BEGIN NOW he walks, greyedauburn. END
BEGIN NOW An azured harebell like her veins. END
BEGIN NOW Lids of END
BEGIN NOW Juno's eyes, violets. END
BEGIN NOW He walks. END
BEGIN NOW One life is all. END
BEGIN NOW One body. END
BEGIN NOW Do. END
BEGIN NOW But do. END
BEGIN NOW Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply. END
BEGIN NOW —Whom do you suspect? END
BEGIN NOW he challenged. END
BEGIN NOW —Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. END
BEGIN NOW Once spurned twice END
BEGIN NOW spurned. END
BEGIN NOW But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove. END
BEGIN NOW Love that dare not speak its name. END
BEGIN NOW —As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a END
BEGIN NOW lord. END
BEGIN NOW Old wall where sudden lizards flash. END
BEGIN NOW At Charenton I watched them. END
BEGIN NOW —It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all END
BEGIN NOW other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the END
BEGIN NOW stallion. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a END
BEGIN NOW shrew to wife. END
BEGIN NOW But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. END
BEGIN NOW Two END
BEGIN NOW deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained END
BEGIN NOW yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet END
BEGIN NOW Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. END
BEGIN NOW Once a wooer, twice a wooer. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen turned boldly in his chair. END
BEGIN NOW —The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. END
BEGIN NOW If you END
BEGIN NOW deny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy END
BEGIN NOW tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years END
BEGIN NOW between the day she married him and the day she buried him. END
BEGIN NOW All those END
BEGIN NOW women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her END
BEGIN NOW poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the END
BEGIN NOW first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her END
BEGIN NOW sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use END
BEGIN NOW granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first. END
BEGIN NOW O, yes, mention there is. END
BEGIN NOW In the years when he was living richly in END
BEGIN NOW royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her END
BEGIN NOW father's shepherd. END
BEGIN NOW Explain you then. END
BEGIN NOW Explain the swansong too wherein he END
BEGIN NOW has commended her to posterity. END
BEGIN NOW He faced their silence. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will. END
BEGIN NOW But that has been explained, I END
BEGIN NOW believe, by jurists. END
BEGIN NOW She was entitled to her widow's dower At common END
BEGIN NOW law. END
BEGIN NOW His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us. END
BEGIN NOW Him Satan fleers, END
BEGIN NOW Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he END
BEGIN NOW did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, END
BEGIN NOW For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW therefore when he was urged, As I believe, to name her He left her his END
BEGIN NOW Secondbest Bed. END
BEGIN NOW Punkt. END
BEGIN NOW Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed END
BEGIN NOW Secabest Leftabed. END
BEGIN NOW Woa! END
BEGIN NOW —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as END
BEGIN NOW they have still if our peasant plays are true to type. END
BEGIN NOW —He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and END
BEGIN NOW landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist END
BEGIN NOW shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he not leave her END
BEGIN NOW his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in END
BEGIN NOW peace? END
BEGIN NOW —It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Secondbest Best said finely. END
BEGIN NOW —Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled END
BEGIN NOW on. END
BEGIN NOW —Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. END
BEGIN NOW Let me think. END
BEGIN NOW —Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays END

BEGIN NOW Stephanos, my crown. END
BEGIN NOW My sword. END
BEGIN NOW His boots are spoiling the shape of my END

BEGIN NOW —You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. END
BEGIN NOW Your own name is END
BEGIN NOW strange enough. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it explains your fantastical humour. END
BEGIN NOW Me, Magee and Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Fabulous artificer. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say: END
BEGIN NOW —That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know, we END
BEGIN NOW find also in the old Irish myths. END
BEGIN NOW Just what you say. END
BEGIN NOW The three brothers END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. END
BEGIN NOW The third END
BEGIN NOW brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize. END
BEGIN NOW Best of Best brothers. END
BEGIN NOW Good, better, best. END
BEGIN NOW The quaker librarian springhalted near. END
BEGIN NOW —I should like to know, he said, which brother you... END
BEGIN NOW I understand you END
BEGIN NOW to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... END
BEGIN NOW But perhaps END
BEGIN NOW I am anticipating? END
BEGIN NOW He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained. END
BEGIN NOW An attendant from the doorway called: END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Lyster! END
BEGIN NOW Father Dineen wants... END
BEGIN NOW —O, Father Dineen! END
BEGIN NOW Directly. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone. END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton touched the foil. END
BEGIN NOW —Come, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW You kept them for the last, didn't you? END
BEGIN NOW —In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and END
BEGIN NOW nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella. END
BEGIN NOW Lapwing. END
BEGIN NOW Where is your brother? END
BEGIN NOW Apothecaries' hall. END
BEGIN NOW My whetstone. END
BEGIN NOW Him, then END
BEGIN NOW Cranly, Mulligan: now these. END
BEGIN NOW Speech, speech. END

BEGIN NOW Act. END

BEGIN NOW My kingdom for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he END
BEGIN NOW took the stuff of his plays. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he take them rather than others? END
BEGIN NOW Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann END
BEGIN NOW (what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. END
BEGIN NOW Richard END
BEGIN NOW the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. END
BEGIN NOW Of all his END
BEGIN NOW kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence, END
BEGIN NOW the angel of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Why is the underplot of King Lear in which END
BEGIN NOW Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a END
BEGIN NOW Celtic legend older than history? END
BEGIN NOW —That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. END
BEGIN NOW We should not now combine END
BEGIN NOW a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. END
BEGIN NOW Que END
BEGIN NOW voulez-vous? END
BEGIN NOW Moore would say. END
BEGIN NOW He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes END
BEGIN NOW Ulysses quote Aristotle. END
BEGIN NOW —Why? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen answered himself. END
BEGIN NOW Because the theme of the false or the END
BEGIN NOW usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. END
BEGIN NOW The note of END
BEGIN NOW banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds END
BEGIN NOW uninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero END
BEGIN NOW breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his END
BEGIN NOW book. END
BEGIN NOW It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in END
BEGIN NOW another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married END
BEGIN NOW daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. END
BEGIN NOW But it END
BEGIN NOW was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will END
BEGIN NOW and left in him a strong inclination to evil. END
BEGIN NOW The words are those of my END
BEGIN NOW lords bishops of Maynooth. END
BEGIN NOW An original sin and, like original sin, END
BEGIN NOW committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. END
BEGIN NOW It is between the END
BEGIN NOW lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under END
BEGIN NOW which her four bones are not to be laid. END
BEGIN NOW Age has not withered it. END
BEGIN NOW Beauty END
BEGIN NOW and peace have not done it away. END
BEGIN NOW It is in infinite variety everywhere in END
BEGIN NOW the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you END
BEGIN NOW like It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure—and in all END
BEGIN NOW the other plays which I have not read. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage. END
BEGIN NOW Judge Eglinton summed up. END
BEGIN NOW —The truth is midway, he affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW He is the ghost and the prince. END
BEGIN NOW He is END
BEGIN NOW all in all. END
BEGIN NOW —He is, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. END
BEGIN NOW All in all. END
BEGIN NOW In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. END
BEGIN NOW He acts and END
BEGIN NOW is acted on. END
BEGIN NOW Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jose he kills the END
BEGIN NOW real Carmen. END
BEGIN NOW His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly END
BEGIN NOW willing that the moor in him shall suffer. END
BEGIN NOW —Cuckoo! END
BEGIN NOW Cuckoo! END
BEGIN NOW Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. END
BEGIN NOW O word of fear! END
BEGIN NOW Dark dome received, reverbed. END
BEGIN NOW —And what a character is Iago! END
BEGIN NOW undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW When END
BEGIN NOW all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas pÃ¨re?) is right. END
BEGIN NOW After God END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare has created most. END
BEGIN NOW —Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW He returns after END
BEGIN NOW a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has END
BEGIN NOW always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of END
BEGIN NOW life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW Then dies. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW motion is ended. END
BEGIN NOW Gravediggers bury Hamlet (pÃ¨re?) and Hamlet fils. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. END
BEGIN NOW And, what END
BEGIN NOW though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, END
BEGIN NOW Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they END
BEGIN NOW refuse to be divorced. END
BEGIN NOW If you like the epilogue look long on it: END
BEGIN NOW prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of END
BEGIN NOW love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the END
BEGIN NOW place where the bad niggers go. END
BEGIN NOW Strong curtain. END
BEGIN NOW He found in the world END
BEGIN NOW without as actual what was in his world within as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Maeterlinck END
BEGIN NOW says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on END
BEGIN NOW his doorstep. END
BEGIN NOW If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will END
BEGIN NOW tend. END
BEGIN NOW Every life is many days, day after day. END
BEGIN NOW We walk through ourselves, END
BEGIN NOW meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, END
BEGIN NOW brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW The playwright who wrote END
BEGIN NOW the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and END
BEGIN NOW the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most END
BEGIN NOW Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all END
BEGIN NOW in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but END
BEGIN NOW that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more END
BEGIN NOW marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto END
BEGIN NOW himself. END
BEGIN NOW —Eureka! END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan cried. END
BEGIN NOW Eureka! END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's END
BEGIN NOW desk. END
BEGIN NOW —May I? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW The Lord has spoken to Malachi. END
BEGIN NOW He began to scribble on a slip of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Take some slips from the counter going out. END
BEGIN NOW —Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall END
BEGIN NOW live. END
BEGIN NOW The rest shall keep as they are. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor. END
BEGIN NOW Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his END
BEGIN NOW variorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew. END
BEGIN NOW —You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW You have END
BEGIN NOW brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. END
BEGIN NOW Do you believe END
BEGIN NOW your own theory? END
BEGIN NOW —No, Stephen said promptly. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you going to write it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Best asked. END
BEGIN NOW You ought to make it a END
BEGIN NOW dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote. END
BEGIN NOW John Eclecticon doubly smiled. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment END
BEGIN NOW for it since you don't believe it yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Dowden believes there is END
BEGIN NOW some mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. END
BEGIN NOW Herr Bleibtreu, the man END
BEGIN NOW Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes END
BEGIN NOW that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. END
BEGIN NOW He is going to END
BEGIN NOW visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor END
BEGIN NOW wrote the plays. END
BEGIN NOW It will come as a surprise to his grace. END
BEGIN NOW But he END
BEGIN NOW believes his theory. END
BEGIN NOW I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. END
BEGIN NOW That is, help me to believe or help END

BEGIN NOW Tide you over. END
BEGIN NOW Economics. END
BEGIN NOW —For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then END
BEGIN NOW gravely said, honeying malice: END
BEGIN NOW —I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper END
BEGIN NOW Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra END
BEGIN NOW Gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and END
BEGIN NOW Rosalie, the coalquay whore. END
BEGIN NOW He broke away. END
BEGIN NOW —Come, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW Come, wandering Ã†ngus of the birds. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Kinch. END
BEGIN NOW You have eaten all we left. END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW I will serve you your orts END
BEGIN NOW and offals. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen rose. END
BEGIN NOW Life is many days. END
BEGIN NOW This will end. END
BEGIN NOW —We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. END
BEGIN NOW Notre ami Moore says END
BEGIN NOW Malachi Mulligan must be there. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama. END
BEGIN NOW —Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of END
BEGIN NOW Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be there. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. END
BEGIN NOW Can you walk END
BEGIN NOW straight? END
BEGIN NOW Laughing, he... END
BEGIN NOW Swill till eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Irish nights entertainment. END
BEGIN NOW Lubber... END
BEGIN NOW Stephen followed a lubber... END
BEGIN NOW One day in the national library we had a discussion. END
BEGIN NOW Shakes. END
BEGIN NOW After. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW lub back: I followed. END
BEGIN NOW I gall his kibe. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt END
BEGIN NOW head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of END
BEGIN NOW no thought. END
BEGIN NOW What have I learned? END
BEGIN NOW Of them? END
BEGIN NOW Of me? END
BEGIN NOW Walk like Haines now. END

BEGIN NOW mad? END
BEGIN NOW The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk. END
BEGIN NOW —O please do, sir... END
BEGIN NOW I shall be most pleased... END
BEGIN NOW Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: END
BEGIN NOW —A pleased bottom. END
BEGIN NOW The turnstile. END
BEGIN NOW Is that?... END
BEGIN NOW Blueribboned hat... END
BEGIN NOW Idly writing... END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Looked?... END
BEGIN NOW The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius. END
BEGIN NOW Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: END
BEGIN NOW John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won't you wed a wife? END
BEGIN NOW He spluttered to the air: END
BEGIN NOW —O, the chinless Chinaman! END
BEGIN NOW Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. END
BEGIN NOW We went over to their END
BEGIN NOW playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. END
BEGIN NOW Our players are creating a END

BEGIN NOW Abbey Theatre! END

BEGIN NOW left the femme de trente ans. END
BEGIN NOW And why no other children born? END

BEGIN NOW Go back. END
BEGIN NOW The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, END
BEGIN NOW minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair. END
BEGIN NOW Eh... END
BEGIN NOW I just eh... END
BEGIN NOW wanted... END
BEGIN NOW I forgot... END
BEGIN NOW he... END
BEGIN NOW —Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there... END
BEGIN NOW Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: END
BEGIN NOW I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a tommy talk as I pass one by Before my END
BEGIN NOW thoughts begin to run On F. END
BEGIN NOW M'Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the END
BEGIN NOW wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his END

BEGIN NOW Being afraid to marry on END
BEGIN NOW earth They masturbated for all they were worth. END
BEGIN NOW Jest on. END
BEGIN NOW Know thyself. END
BEGIN NOW Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. END
BEGIN NOW I halt. END
BEGIN NOW —Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. END
BEGIN NOW Synge has left off wearing black END
BEGIN NOW to be like nature. END
BEGIN NOW Only crows, priests and English coal are black. END
BEGIN NOW A laugh tripped over his lips. END
BEGIN NOW —Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old END
BEGIN NOW hake Gregory. END
BEGIN NOW O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! END
BEGIN NOW She gets you a job END
BEGIN NOW on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't END
BEGIN NOW you do the Yeats touch? END
BEGIN NOW He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: END
BEGIN NOW —The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. END
BEGIN NOW One thinks of Homer. END
BEGIN NOW He stopped at the stairfoot. END
BEGIN NOW —I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. END
BEGIN NOW Gone the nine men's morrice END
BEGIN NOW with caps of indices. END
BEGIN NOW In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: Everyman His END
BEGIN NOW own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three END
BEGIN NOW orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —The disguise, I fear, is thin. END
BEGIN NOW But listen. END
BEGIN NOW He read, marcato: END
BEGIN NOW —Characters: END
BEGIN NOW TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK ) and END
BEGIN NOW ) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY ) MOTHER GROGAN (a END
BEGIN NOW watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore). END
BEGIN NOW He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: END
BEGIN NOW and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: END
BEGIN NOW —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift END
BEGIN NOW their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, END
BEGIN NOW multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! END
BEGIN NOW —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside. END
BEGIN NOW Part. END
BEGIN NOW The moment is now. END
BEGIN NOW Where then? END
BEGIN NOW If Socrates leave his house today, END
BEGIN NOW if Judas go forth tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW That lies in space which I in time must END
BEGIN NOW come to, ineluctably. END
BEGIN NOW My will: his will that fronts me. END
BEGIN NOW Seas between. END
BEGIN NOW A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day again, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW The portico. END
BEGIN NOW Here I watched the birds for augury. END
BEGIN NOW Ã†ngus of the birds. END
BEGIN NOW They go, they END
BEGIN NOW come. END
BEGIN NOW Last night I flew. END
BEGIN NOW Easily flew. END
BEGIN NOW Men wondered. END
BEGIN NOW Street of harlots END
BEGIN NOW after. END
BEGIN NOW A creamfruit melon he held to me. END
BEGIN NOW In. END
BEGIN NOW You will see. END
BEGIN NOW —The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. END
BEGIN NOW Did you END
BEGIN NOW see his eye? END
BEGIN NOW He looked upon you to lust after you. END
BEGIN NOW I fear thee, ancient END
BEGIN NOW mariner. END
BEGIN NOW O, Kinch, thou art in peril. END
BEGIN NOW Get thee a breechpad. END
BEGIN NOW Manner of Oxenford. END
BEGIN NOW Day. END
BEGIN NOW Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge. END
BEGIN NOW A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, END
BEGIN NOW under portcullis barbs. END
BEGIN NOW They followed. END
BEGIN NOW Offend me still. END
BEGIN NOW Speak on. END
BEGIN NOW Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. END
BEGIN NOW No birds. END
BEGIN NOW Frail END
BEGIN NOW from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw END
BEGIN NOW of softness softly were blown. END
BEGIN NOW Cease to strive. END
BEGIN NOW Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: END
BEGIN NOW from wide earth an altar. END
BEGIN NOW Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From END
BEGIN NOW our bless'd altars. END
BEGIN NOW [ 10 ] END
BEGIN NOW The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. END
BEGIN NOW reset his smooth watch END
BEGIN NOW in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. END
BEGIN NOW Five to END
BEGIN NOW three. END
BEGIN NOW Just nice time to walk to Artane. END
BEGIN NOW What was that boy's name again? END
BEGIN NOW Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Vere dignum et iustum est. END
BEGIN NOW Brother Swan was the person to END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cunningham's letter. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Oblige him, if possible. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW practical catholic: useful at mission time. END
BEGIN NOW A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his END
BEGIN NOW crutches, growled some notes. END
BEGIN NOW He jerked short before the convent of the END
BEGIN NOW sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very END
BEGIN NOW reverend John Conmee S. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his END
BEGIN NOW purse held, he knew, one silver crown. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. END
BEGIN NOW He thought, but not for long, END
BEGIN NOW of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, END
BEGIN NOW ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: END
BEGIN NOW If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have END
BEGIN NOW abandoned me in my old days. END
BEGIN NOW He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking END
BEGIN NOW leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. END
BEGIN NOW —Very well, indeed, father. END
BEGIN NOW And you, father? END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. END
BEGIN NOW He would go to Buxton END
BEGIN NOW probably for the waters. END
BEGIN NOW And her boys, were they getting on well at END
BEGIN NOW Belvedere? END
BEGIN NOW Was that so? END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. END
BEGIN NOW And Mr Sheehy himself? END
BEGIN NOW Still in London. END
BEGIN NOW The house was still sitting, to END
BEGIN NOW be sure it was. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was END
BEGIN NOW very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. END
BEGIN NOW O, END
BEGIN NOW yes: a very great success. END
BEGIN NOW A wonderful man really. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. END
BEGIN NOW Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he would certainly call. END
BEGIN NOW —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the END
BEGIN NOW jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW And smiled yet again, END
BEGIN NOW in going. END
BEGIN NOW He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father END
BEGIN NOW Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice. END
BEGIN NOW —Pilate! END
BEGIN NOW Wy don't you old back that owlin mob? END
BEGIN NOW A zealous man, however. END
BEGIN NOW Really he was. END
BEGIN NOW And really did great good in his END
BEGIN NOW way. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. END
BEGIN NOW Of good family too would one think it? END
BEGIN NOW Welsh, were they not? END
BEGIN NOW O, lest he forget. END
BEGIN NOW That letter to father provincial. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy END
BEGIN NOW square. END
BEGIN NOW Yes: they were from Belvedere. END
BEGIN NOW The little house. END
BEGIN NOW Aha. END
BEGIN NOW And were END
BEGIN NOW they good boys at school? END
BEGIN NOW O. END
BEGIN NOW That was very good now. END
BEGIN NOW And what was his END
BEGIN NOW name? END
BEGIN NOW Jack Sohan. END
BEGIN NOW And his name? END
BEGIN NOW Ger. END
BEGIN NOW Gallaher. END
BEGIN NOW And the other little man? END
BEGIN NOW His name was Brunny Lynam. END
BEGIN NOW O, that was a very nice name to have. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and END
BEGIN NOW pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street. END
BEGIN NOW —But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: END
BEGIN NOW —O, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said. END
BEGIN NOW Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter END
BEGIN NOW to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. END
BEGIN NOW Father END
BEGIN NOW Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square END
BEGIN NOW east. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate END
BEGIN NOW frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender END
BEGIN NOW trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave END
BEGIN NOW deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady END
BEGIN NOW Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court. END
BEGIN NOW Was that not Mrs M'Guinness? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the END
BEGIN NOW farther footpath along which she sailed. END
BEGIN NOW And Father Conmee smiled and END
BEGIN NOW saluted. END
BEGIN NOW How did she do? END
BEGIN NOW A fine carriage she had. END
BEGIN NOW Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. END
BEGIN NOW And to END
BEGIN NOW think that she was a pawnbroker! END
BEGIN NOW Well, now! END
BEGIN NOW Such a... END
BEGIN NOW what should he END
BEGIN NOW say?... END
BEGIN NOW such a queenly mien. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup END
BEGIN NOW free church on his left. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend T. END
BEGIN NOW R. END
BEGIN NOW Greene B.A. END
BEGIN NOW will (D.V.) END
BEGIN NOW speak. END
BEGIN NOW The incumbent they called him. END
BEGIN NOW He felt it incumbent on him to say END
BEGIN NOW a few words. END
BEGIN NOW But one should be charitable. END
BEGIN NOW Invincible ignorance. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW acted according to their lights. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular END
BEGIN NOW road. END
BEGIN NOW It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important END
BEGIN NOW thoroughfare. END
BEGIN NOW Surely, there ought to be. END
BEGIN NOW A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. END
BEGIN NOW All raised END
BEGIN NOW untidy caps. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. END
BEGIN NOW Christian brother boys. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. END
BEGIN NOW Saint END
BEGIN NOW Joseph's church, Portland row. END
BEGIN NOW For aged and virtuous females. END
BEGIN NOW Father END
BEGIN NOW Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW Virtuous: but END
BEGIN NOW occasionally they were also badtempered. END
BEGIN NOW Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift END
BEGIN NOW nobleman. END
BEGIN NOW And now it was an office or something. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted END
BEGIN NOW by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. END
BEGIN NOW Father END
BEGIN NOW Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came END
BEGIN NOW from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. END
BEGIN NOW He passed Grogan's the END
BEGIN NOW Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful END
BEGIN NOW catastrophe in New York. END
BEGIN NOW In America those things were continually END
BEGIN NOW happening. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. END
BEGIN NOW Still, an END
BEGIN NOW act of perfect contrition. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of END
BEGIN NOW which two unlabouring men lounged. END
BEGIN NOW They saluted him and were saluted. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee passed H. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny END
BEGIN NOW Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted END
BEGIN NOW the constable. END
BEGIN NOW In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee END
BEGIN NOW observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in END
BEGIN NOW tubes. END
BEGIN NOW Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a END
BEGIN NOW turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty END
BEGIN NOW straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of END
BEGIN NOW the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out END
BEGIN NOW and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor END
BEGIN NOW people. END
BEGIN NOW On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. END
BEGIN NOW of saint Francis END
BEGIN NOW Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound END
BEGIN NOW tram. END
BEGIN NOW Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW of END
BEGIN NOW saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge. END
BEGIN NOW At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for END
BEGIN NOW he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with END
BEGIN NOW care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence END
BEGIN NOW and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. END
BEGIN NOW Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually END
BEGIN NOW made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive END
BEGIN NOW for a journey so short and cheap. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum. END
BEGIN NOW It was a peaceful day. END
BEGIN NOW The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father END
BEGIN NOW Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. END
BEGIN NOW His wife, Father Conmee END
BEGIN NOW supposed. END
BEGIN NOW A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with END
BEGIN NOW the glasses. END
BEGIN NOW She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, END
BEGIN NOW tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, END
BEGIN NOW sweetly. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. END
BEGIN NOW He perceived also that END
BEGIN NOW the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the END
BEGIN NOW seat. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the END
BEGIN NOW mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. END
BEGIN NOW At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old END
BEGIN NOW woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. END
BEGIN NOW The conductor pulled the END
BEGIN NOW bellstrap to stay the car for her. END
BEGIN NOW She passed out with her basket and a END
BEGIN NOW marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and END
BEGIN NOW basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed END
BEGIN NOW the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had END
BEGIN NOW always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been END
BEGIN NOW absolved, pray for me. END
BEGIN NOW But they had so many worries in life, so many END
BEGIN NOW cares, poor creatures. END
BEGIN NOW From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and END
BEGIN NOW of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. END
BEGIN NOW and the African mission and of END
BEGIN NOW the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and END
BEGIN NOW yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last END
BEGIN NOW hour came like a thief in the night. END
BEGIN NOW That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le END
BEGIN NOW Nombre des Ã‰lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. END
BEGIN NOW Those were END
BEGIN NOW millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the END
BEGIN NOW faith had not (D.V.) been brought. END
BEGIN NOW But they were God's souls, created by END
BEGIN NOW God. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a END
BEGIN NOW waste, if one might say. END
BEGIN NOW At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the END
BEGIN NOW conductor and saluted in his turn. END
BEGIN NOW The Malahide road was quiet. END
BEGIN NOW It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. END
BEGIN NOW The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Talbot de Malahide, END
BEGIN NOW immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. END
BEGIN NOW Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. END
BEGIN NOW Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times END
BEGIN NOW in the barony. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the END
BEGIN NOW Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of END
BEGIN NOW Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere. END
BEGIN NOW A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, END
BEGIN NOW Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, END
BEGIN NOW not startled when an otter plunged. END
BEGIN NOW Who could know the truth? END
BEGIN NOW Not the END
BEGIN NOW jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed END
BEGIN NOW adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her END
BEGIN NOW husband's brother? END
BEGIN NOW She would half confess if she had not all sinned as END
BEGIN NOW women did. END
BEGIN NOW Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for END
BEGIN NOW man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways. END
BEGIN NOW Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. END
BEGIN NOW He was humane and END
BEGIN NOW honoured there. END
BEGIN NOW He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at END
BEGIN NOW smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit END
BEGIN NOW clusters. END
BEGIN NOW And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, END
BEGIN NOW were impalmed by Don John Conmee. END
BEGIN NOW It was a charming day. END
BEGIN NOW The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, END
BEGIN NOW curtseying to him with ample underleaves. END
BEGIN NOW The sky showed him a flock of END
BEGIN NOW small white clouds going slowly down the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Moutonner, the French END
BEGIN NOW said. END
BEGIN NOW A just and homely word. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds END
BEGIN NOW over Rathcoffey. END
BEGIN NOW His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of END
BEGIN NOW Clongowes field. END
BEGIN NOW He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the END
BEGIN NOW cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet END
BEGIN NOW evening. END
BEGIN NOW He was their rector: his reign was mild. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. END
BEGIN NOW An END
BEGIN NOW ivory bookmark told him the page. END
BEGIN NOW Nones. END
BEGIN NOW He should have read that before lunch. END
BEGIN NOW But lady Maxwell had come. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Deus END
BEGIN NOW in adiutorium. END
BEGIN NOW He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he END
BEGIN NOW came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in END
BEGIN NOW eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae. END
BEGIN NOW A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a END
BEGIN NOW young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. END
BEGIN NOW The young man raised END
BEGIN NOW his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care END
BEGIN NOW detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his END
BEGIN NOW breviary. END
BEGIN NOW Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis END
BEGIN NOW formidavit cor meum. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye END
BEGIN NOW at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW He pulled himself erect, went END
BEGIN NOW to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass END
BEGIN NOW furnishings. END
BEGIN NOW Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came END
BEGIN NOW to the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes END
BEGIN NOW and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out. END
BEGIN NOW Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat END
BEGIN NOW downtilted, chewing his blade of hay. END
BEGIN NOW Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day. END
BEGIN NOW —That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, Corny Kelleher said. END
BEGIN NOW —It's very close, the constable said. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth END
BEGIN NOW while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a END
BEGIN NOW coin. END
BEGIN NOW —What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with END
BEGIN NOW bated breath. END
BEGIN NOW A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting END
BEGIN NOW Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW Towards END
BEGIN NOW Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: END
BEGIN NOW —For England... END
BEGIN NOW He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted END
BEGIN NOW and growled: END
BEGIN NOW —home and beauty. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the END
BEGIN NOW warehouse with a visitor. END
BEGIN NOW A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it END
BEGIN NOW into the cap held out to her. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly END
BEGIN NOW at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four END
BEGIN NOW strides. END
BEGIN NOW He halted and growled angrily: END
BEGIN NOW —For England... END
BEGIN NOW Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, END
BEGIN NOW gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths. END
BEGIN NOW He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head END
BEGIN NOW towards a window and bayed deeply: END
BEGIN NOW —home and beauty. END
BEGIN NOW The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. END
BEGIN NOW The blind of the window was drawn aside. END
BEGIN NOW A card Unfurnished Apartments END
BEGIN NOW slipped from the sash and fell. END
BEGIN NOW A plump bare generous arm shone, was END
BEGIN NOW seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. END
BEGIN NOW It fell on the END
BEGIN NOW path. END
BEGIN NOW One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the END
BEGIN NOW minstrel's cap, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —There, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you put in the books? END
BEGIN NOW Boody asked. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds END
BEGIN NOW twice with her potstick and wiped her brow. END
BEGIN NOW —They wouldn't give anything on them, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles END
BEGIN NOW tickled by stubble. END
BEGIN NOW —Where did you try? END
BEGIN NOW Boody asked. END
BEGIN NOW —M'Guinness's. END
BEGIN NOW Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table. END
BEGIN NOW —Bad cess to her big face! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —What's in the pot? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Shirts, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW Boody cried angrily: END
BEGIN NOW —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat? END
BEGIN NOW Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: END
BEGIN NOW —And what's in this? END
BEGIN NOW A heavy fume gushed in answer. END
BEGIN NOW —Peasoup, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW —Where did you get it? END
BEGIN NOW Katey asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey rang his bell. END
BEGIN NOW —Barang! END
BEGIN NOW Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: END
BEGIN NOW —Give us it here. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. END
BEGIN NOW Katey, END
BEGIN NOW sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her END
BEGIN NOW mouth random crumbs: END
BEGIN NOW —A good job we have that much. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Dilly? END
BEGIN NOW —Gone to meet father, Maggy said. END
BEGIN NOW Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: END
BEGIN NOW —Our father who art not in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed: END
BEGIN NOW —Boody! END
BEGIN NOW For shame! END
BEGIN NOW A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the END
BEGIN NOW Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed END
BEGIN NOW around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, END
BEGIN NOW between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling END
BEGIN NOW fibre. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper END
BEGIN NOW and a small jar. END
BEGIN NOW —Put these in first, will you? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, the blond girl said. END
BEGIN NOW And the fruit on top. END
BEGIN NOW —That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said. END
BEGIN NOW She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe END
BEGIN NOW shamefaced peaches. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the END
BEGIN NOW fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red END
BEGIN NOW tomatoes, sniffing smells. END
BEGIN NOW H. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW L. END
BEGIN NOW Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, END
BEGIN NOW plodding towards their goal. END
BEGIN NOW He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from END
BEGIN NOW his fob and held it at its chain's length. END
BEGIN NOW —Can you send them by tram? END
BEGIN NOW Now? END
BEGIN NOW A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's END
BEGIN NOW cart. END
BEGIN NOW —Certainly, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Is it in the city? END
BEGIN NOW —O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil. END
BEGIN NOW —Will you write the address, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her. END
BEGIN NOW —Send it at once, will you? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW It's for an invalid. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I will, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket. END
BEGIN NOW —What's the damage? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. END
BEGIN NOW A young pullet. END
BEGIN NOW He took END
BEGIN NOW a red carnation from the tall stemglass. END
BEGIN NOW —This for me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked gallantly. END
BEGIN NOW The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie END
BEGIN NOW a bit crooked, blushing. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the END
BEGIN NOW red flower between his smiling teeth. END
BEGIN NOW —May I say a word to your telephone, missy? END
BEGIN NOW he asked roguishly. END
BEGIN NOW —Ma! END
BEGIN NOW Almidano Artifoni said. END
BEGIN NOW He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll. END
BEGIN NOW Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, END
BEGIN NOW gripping the handrests. END
BEGIN NOW Palefaces. END
BEGIN NOW Men's arms frankly round their END
BEGIN NOW stunted forms. END
BEGIN NOW They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of END
BEGIN NOW the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed. END
BEGIN NOW —Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero END
BEGIN NOW giovine come Lei. END
BEGIN NOW Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo Ã¨ una bestia. END
BEGIN NOW Ãˆ END
BEGIN NOW peccato. END
BEGIN NOW PerchÃ¨ la sua voce... END
BEGIN NOW sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. END
BEGIN NOW Invece, Lei si sacrifica. END
BEGIN NOW —Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in END
BEGIN NOW slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly. END
BEGIN NOW —Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. END
BEGIN NOW Ma, dia retta a END
BEGIN NOW me. END
BEGIN NOW Ci rifletta. END
BEGIN NOW By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram END
BEGIN NOW unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band. END
BEGIN NOW —Ci rifletterÃ², Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg. END
BEGIN NOW —Ma, sul serio, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Almidano Artifoni said. END
BEGIN NOW His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. END
BEGIN NOW Human eyes. END
BEGIN NOW They gazed curiously END
BEGIN NOW an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram. END
BEGIN NOW —Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. END
BEGIN NOW Venga a trovarmi e ci END
BEGIN NOW pensi. END
BEGIN NOW Addio, caro. END
BEGIN NOW —Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was END
BEGIN NOW freed. END
BEGIN NOW E grazie. END
BEGIN NOW —Di che? END
BEGIN NOW Almidano Artifoni said. END
BEGIN NOW Scusi, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Tante belle cose! END
BEGIN NOW Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, END
BEGIN NOW trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. END
BEGIN NOW In vain he trotted, END
BEGIN NOW signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling END
BEGIN NOW implements of music through Trinity gates. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far END
BEGIN NOW back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her END
BEGIN NOW typewriter. END
BEGIN NOW Too much mystery business in it. END
BEGIN NOW Is he in love with that one, Marion? END
BEGIN NOW Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye. END
BEGIN NOW The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: END
BEGIN NOW six. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: END
BEGIN NOW —16 June 1904. END
BEGIN NOW Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab END
BEGIN NOW where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW L. END
BEGIN NOW Y.'S and plodded back as they had come. END
BEGIN NOW Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming END
BEGIN NOW soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and END
BEGIN NOW capital esses. END
BEGIN NOW Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW She's not nicelooking, is END
BEGIN NOW she? END
BEGIN NOW The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder will that END
BEGIN NOW fellow be at the band tonight. END
BEGIN NOW If I could get that dressmaker to make a END
BEGIN NOW concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. END
BEGIN NOW They kick out grand. END
BEGIN NOW Shannon and all END
BEGIN NOW the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. END
BEGIN NOW Hope to goodness he END
BEGIN NOW won't keep me here till seven. END
BEGIN NOW The telephone rang rudely by her ear. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I'll ring them up after five. END
BEGIN NOW Only END
BEGIN NOW those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. END
BEGIN NOW All right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Then I can go END
BEGIN NOW after six if you're not back. END
BEGIN NOW A quarter after. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Twentyseven and END
BEGIN NOW six. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell him. END
BEGIN NOW Yes: one, seven, six. END
BEGIN NOW She scribbled three figures on an envelope. END
BEGIN NOW —Mr Boylan! END
BEGIN NOW Hello! END
BEGIN NOW That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. END
BEGIN NOW Mr END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, yes. END
BEGIN NOW He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I'll ring them up after five. END
BEGIN NOW Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch. END
BEGIN NOW —Who's that? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert asked. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Crotty? END
BEGIN NOW —Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Jack, is that yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his END
BEGIN NOW pliant lath among the flickering arches. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Mind your steps there. END
BEGIN NOW The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long END
BEGIN NOW soft flame and was let fall. END
BEGIN NOW At their feet its red speck died: and END
BEGIN NOW mouldy air closed round them. END
BEGIN NOW —How interesting! END
BEGIN NOW a refined accent said in the gloom. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. END
BEGIN NOW We are standing in the historic END
BEGIN NOW council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed END
BEGIN NOW himself a rebel in 1534. END
BEGIN NOW This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. END
BEGIN NOW The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and END
BEGIN NOW the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue END
BEGIN NOW over in Adelaide road. END
BEGIN NOW You were never here before, Jack, were you? END
BEGIN NOW —No, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW —He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory END
BEGIN NOW serves me. END
BEGIN NOW The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court. END
BEGIN NOW —That's right, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW That's quite right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW —If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow END
BEGIN NOW me perhaps... END
BEGIN NOW —Certainly, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW Bring the camera whenever you like. END
BEGIN NOW I'll END
BEGIN NOW get those bags cleared away from the windows. END
BEGIN NOW You can take it from here END
BEGIN NOW or from here. END
BEGIN NOW In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled END
BEGIN NOW seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. END
BEGIN NOW I won't trespass on END
BEGIN NOW your valuable time... END
BEGIN NOW —You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. END
BEGIN NOW Drop in whenever you like. END
BEGIN NOW Next END
BEGIN NOW week, say. END
BEGIN NOW Can you see? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. END
BEGIN NOW Very pleased to have met you. END
BEGIN NOW —Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered. END
BEGIN NOW He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among END
BEGIN NOW the pillars. END
BEGIN NOW With J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey END
BEGIN NOW where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, END
BEGIN NOW O'Connor, Wexford. END
BEGIN NOW He stood to read the card in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW —The reverend Hugh C. END
BEGIN NOW Love, Rathcoffey. END
BEGIN NOW Present address: Saint END
BEGIN NOW Michael's, Sallins. END
BEGIN NOW Nice young chap he is. END
BEGIN NOW He's writing a book about the END
BEGIN NOW Fitzgeralds he told me. END
BEGIN NOW He's well up in history, faith. END
BEGIN NOW The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging END
BEGIN NOW twig. END
BEGIN NOW —I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said. END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air. END
BEGIN NOW —God! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare END
BEGIN NOW after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. END
BEGIN NOW You know that one? END
BEGIN NOW I'm bloody END
BEGIN NOW sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop END
BEGIN NOW was inside. END
BEGIN NOW He mightn't like it, though. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW God, I'll tell him END
BEGIN NOW anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. END
BEGIN NOW Hot members they END
BEGIN NOW were all of them, the Geraldines. END
BEGIN NOW The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: END
BEGIN NOW —Woa, sonny! END
BEGIN NOW He turned to J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy and asked: END
BEGIN NOW —Well, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW What's the trouble? END
BEGIN NOW Wait awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Hold hard. END
BEGIN NOW With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an END
BEGIN NOW instant, sneezed loudly. END
BEGIN NOW —Chow! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Blast you! END
BEGIN NOW —The dust from those sacks, J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Molloy said politely. END
BEGIN NOW —No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... END
BEGIN NOW cold night before... END
BEGIN NOW blast your END
BEGIN NOW soul... END
BEGIN NOW night before last... END
BEGIN NOW and there was a hell of a lot of draught... END
BEGIN NOW He held his handkerchief ready for the coming... END
BEGIN NOW —I was... END
BEGIN NOW Glasnevin this morning... END
BEGIN NOW poor little... END
BEGIN NOW what do you call END
BEGIN NOW him... END
BEGIN NOW Chow!... END
BEGIN NOW Mother of Moses! END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his END
BEGIN NOW claret waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW —See? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Say it's turn six. END
BEGIN NOW In here, see. END
BEGIN NOW Turn Now On. END
BEGIN NOW He slid it into the left slot for them. END
BEGIN NOW It shot down the groove, wobbled END
BEGIN NOW a while, ceased, ogling them: six. END
BEGIN NOW Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the END
BEGIN NOW consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying END
BEGIN NOW the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the END
BEGIN NOW admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly END
BEGIN NOW female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of END
BEGIN NOW great amplitude. END
BEGIN NOW —See? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. END
BEGIN NOW The impact. END
BEGIN NOW Leverage, see? END
BEGIN NOW He showed them the rising column of disks on the right. END
BEGIN NOW —Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. END
BEGIN NOW So a fellow coming in late can END
BEGIN NOW see what turn is on and what turns are over. END
BEGIN NOW —See? END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford said. END
BEGIN NOW He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: END
BEGIN NOW four. END
BEGIN NOW Turn Now On. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. END
BEGIN NOW One good END
BEGIN NOW turn deserves another. END
BEGIN NOW —Do, Tom Rochford said. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience. END
BEGIN NOW —Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. END
BEGIN NOW When you two begin END
BEGIN NOW Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it. END
BEGIN NOW —But how does it work here, Tommy? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Tooraloo, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW See you later. END
BEGIN NOW He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court. END
BEGIN NOW —He's a hero, he said simply. END
BEGIN NOW —I know, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The drain, you mean. END
BEGIN NOW —Drain? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW It was down a manhole. END
BEGIN NOW They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming END
BEGIN NOW soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. END
BEGIN NOW Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. END
BEGIN NOW One of those manholes like END
BEGIN NOW a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half END
BEGIN NOW choked with sewer gas. END
BEGIN NOW Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and END
BEGIN NOW all, with the rope round him. END
BEGIN NOW And be damned but he got the rope round END
BEGIN NOW the poor devil and the two were hauled up. END
BEGIN NOW —The act of a hero, he said. END
BEGIN NOW At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past END
BEGIN NOW them for Jervis street. END
BEGIN NOW —This way, he said, walking to the right. END
BEGIN NOW I want to pop into Lynam's to END
BEGIN NOW see Sceptre's starting price. END
BEGIN NOW What's the time by your gold watch and END
BEGIN NOW chain? END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's END
BEGIN NOW clock. END
BEGIN NOW —After three, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Who's riding her? END
BEGIN NOW —O. END
BEGIN NOW Madden, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW And a game filly she is. END
BEGIN NOW While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle END
BEGIN NOW pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow might damn easy END
BEGIN NOW get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal END
BEGIN NOW cavalcade. END
BEGIN NOW —Even money, Lenehan said returning. END
BEGIN NOW I knocked against Bantam Lyons in END
BEGIN NOW there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an END
BEGIN NOW earthly. END
BEGIN NOW Through here. END
BEGIN NOW They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. END
BEGIN NOW A darkbacked figure END
BEGIN NOW scanned books on the hawker's cart. END
BEGIN NOW —There he is, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW —Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind. END
BEGIN NOW —Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW —He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW I was with him one day and he END
BEGIN NOW bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. END
BEGIN NOW There were END
BEGIN NOW fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and END
BEGIN NOW comets with long tails. END
BEGIN NOW Astronomy it was about. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan laughed. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Come over END
BEGIN NOW in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the END
BEGIN NOW riverwall. END
BEGIN NOW Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, END
BEGIN NOW carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. END
BEGIN NOW —There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said END
BEGIN NOW eagerly. END
BEGIN NOW The annual dinner, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Boiled shirt affair. END
BEGIN NOW The lord END
BEGIN NOW mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan END
BEGIN NOW Dawson spoke and there was music. END
BEGIN NOW Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin END
BEGIN NOW Dollard... END
BEGIN NOW —I know, M'Coy broke in. END
BEGIN NOW My missus sang there once. END
BEGIN NOW —Did she? END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 END
BEGIN NOW Eccles street. END
BEGIN NOW He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. END
BEGIN NOW —But wait till I tell you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Delahunt of Camden street had the END
BEGIN NOW catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom and the wife were END
BEGIN NOW there. END
BEGIN NOW Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to END
BEGIN NOW which we did ample justice. END
BEGIN NOW Fast and furious it was. END
BEGIN NOW After liquids came END
BEGIN NOW solids. END
BEGIN NOW Cold joints galore and mince pies... END
BEGIN NOW —I know, M'Coy said. END
BEGIN NOW The year the missus was there... END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan linked his arm warmly. END
BEGIN NOW —But wait till I tell you, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We had a midnight lunch too after END
BEGIN NOW all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the END
BEGIN NOW morning after the night before. END
BEGIN NOW Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's END
BEGIN NOW night on the Featherbed Mountain. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one END
BEGIN NOW side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. END
BEGIN NOW We started singing END
BEGIN NOW glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. END
BEGIN NOW She was well primed with END
BEGIN NOW a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. END
BEGIN NOW Every jolt the END
BEGIN NOW bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. END
BEGIN NOW Hell's delights! END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW has a fine pair, God bless her. END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: END
BEGIN NOW —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Know END
BEGIN NOW what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW His hands moulded ample curves of air. END
BEGIN NOW He shut his eyes tight in END
BEGIN NOW delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. END
BEGIN NOW —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW She's a gamey END
BEGIN NOW mare and no mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets END
BEGIN NOW in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and END
BEGIN NOW Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. END
BEGIN NOW But, by God, I was END
BEGIN NOW lost, so to speak, in the milky way. END
BEGIN NOW He knows them all, faith. END
BEGIN NOW At last END
BEGIN NOW she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. END
BEGIN NOW And what star is that, Poldy? END
BEGIN NOW says she. END
BEGIN NOW By God, she had Bloom cornered. END
BEGIN NOW That one, is it? END
BEGIN NOW says Chris END
BEGIN NOW Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. END
BEGIN NOW By God, he END
BEGIN NOW wasn't far wide of the mark. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm weak, he gasped. END
BEGIN NOW M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan END
BEGIN NOW walked on again. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead END
BEGIN NOW rapidly. END
BEGIN NOW He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy. END
BEGIN NOW —He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. END
BEGIN NOW He's not one END
BEGIN NOW of your common or garden... END
BEGIN NOW you know... END
BEGIN NOW There's a touch of the artist END
BEGIN NOW about old Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, END
BEGIN NOW then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. END
BEGIN NOW Crooked botched print. END
BEGIN NOW Plates: infants END
BEGIN NOW cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. END
BEGIN NOW All butting END
BEGIN NOW with their skulls to get out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Child born every minute somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Purefoy. END
BEGIN NOW He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto END
BEGIN NOW by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. END
BEGIN NOW —That I had, he said, pushing it by. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW —Them are two good ones, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his END
BEGIN NOW unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. END
BEGIN NOW On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay END
BEGIN NOW apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. END
BEGIN NOW Know the kind that is. END
BEGIN NOW Had it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He opened it. END
BEGIN NOW Thought so. END
BEGIN NOW A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. END
BEGIN NOW Listen: the man. END
BEGIN NOW No: she wouldn't like that much. END
BEGIN NOW Got her it once. END
BEGIN NOW He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. END
BEGIN NOW More in her line. END
BEGIN NOW Let us see. END
BEGIN NOW He read where his finger opened. END
BEGIN NOW —All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on END
BEGIN NOW wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. END
BEGIN NOW For him! END
BEGIN NOW For raoul! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW This. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW Try. END
BEGIN NOW —Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands END
BEGIN NOW felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabillÃ©. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Take this. END
BEGIN NOW The end. END
BEGIN NOW —You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly END
BEGIN NOW shoulders and heaving embonpoint. END
BEGIN NOW An imperceptible smile played round END
BEGIN NOW her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman. END
BEGIN NOW Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Flesh yielded amply END
BEGIN NOW amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. END
BEGIN NOW His nostrils arched END
BEGIN NOW themselves for prey. END
BEGIN NOW Melting breast ointments (for Him! END
BEGIN NOW For Raoul!). END
BEGIN NOW Armpits' oniony sweat. END
BEGIN NOW Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). END
BEGIN NOW Feel! END
BEGIN NOW Press! END
BEGIN NOW Crushed! END
BEGIN NOW Sulphur dung of lions! END
BEGIN NOW Young! END
BEGIN NOW Young! END
BEGIN NOW An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of END
BEGIN NOW chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the END
BEGIN NOW lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the END
BEGIN NOW admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the END
BEGIN NOW Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal END
BEGIN NOW reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident END
BEGIN NOW and Guarantee Corporation. END
BEGIN NOW Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy END
BEGIN NOW curtains. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven END
BEGIN NOW reddened face, coughing. END
BEGIN NOW He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the END
BEGIN NOW floor. END
BEGIN NOW He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, END
BEGIN NOW and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom beheld it. END
BEGIN NOW Mastering his troubled breath, he said: END
BEGIN NOW —I'll take this one. END
BEGIN NOW The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. END
BEGIN NOW —Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. END
BEGIN NOW That's a good one. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell END
BEGIN NOW twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. END
BEGIN NOW Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, END
BEGIN NOW the cries of the auctioneer within. END
BEGIN NOW Four and nine. END
BEGIN NOW Those lovely END
BEGIN NOW curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Cosy curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Selling new at two guineas. END
BEGIN NOW Any END
BEGIN NOW advance on five shillings? END
BEGIN NOW Going for five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: END
BEGIN NOW —Barang! END
BEGIN NOW Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW halted near his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW —It's time for you, she said. END
BEGIN NOW —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Are END
BEGIN NOW you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon END
BEGIN NOW shoulder? END
BEGIN NOW Melancholy God! END
BEGIN NOW Dilly shrugged her shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and END
BEGIN NOW held them back. END
BEGIN NOW —Stand up straight, girl, he said. END
BEGIN NOW You'll get curvature of the spine. END
BEGIN NOW Do END
BEGIN NOW you know what you look like? END
BEGIN NOW He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders END
BEGIN NOW and dropping his underjaw. END
BEGIN NOW —Give it up, father, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW All the people are looking at you. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you get any money? END
BEGIN NOW Dilly asked. END
BEGIN NOW —Where would I get money? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW There is no-one in Dublin END
BEGIN NOW would lend me fourpence. END
BEGIN NOW —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —How do you know that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along END
BEGIN NOW James's street. END
BEGIN NOW —I know you did, Dilly answered. END
BEGIN NOW Were you in the Scotch house now? END
BEGIN NOW —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Was it the little nuns END
BEGIN NOW taught you to be so saucy? END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW He handed her a shilling. END
BEGIN NOW —See if you can do anything with that, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —I suppose you got five, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW Give me more than that. END
BEGIN NOW —Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. END
BEGIN NOW You're like the rest of END
BEGIN NOW them, are you? END
BEGIN NOW An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother END
BEGIN NOW died. END
BEGIN NOW But wait awhile. END
BEGIN NOW You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from END
BEGIN NOW me. END
BEGIN NOW Low blackguardism! END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to get rid of you. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't care if I END
BEGIN NOW was stretched out stiff. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead. END
BEGIN NOW The man upstairs is dead. END
BEGIN NOW He left her and walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, what is it? END
BEGIN NOW he said, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. END
BEGIN NOW —Barang! END
BEGIN NOW —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but END
BEGIN NOW feebly: END
BEGIN NOW —Bang! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus stared at him. END
BEGIN NOW —Watch him, he said. END
BEGIN NOW It's instructive. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder will he allow us to END
BEGIN NOW talk. END
BEGIN NOW —You got more than that, father, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you END
BEGIN NOW all where Jesus left the jews. END
BEGIN NOW Look, there's all I have. END
BEGIN NOW I got two END
BEGIN NOW shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the END
BEGIN NOW funeral. END
BEGIN NOW He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously. END
BEGIN NOW —Can't you look for some money somewhere? END
BEGIN NOW Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus thought and nodded. END
BEGIN NOW —I will, he said gravely. END
BEGIN NOW I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell END
BEGIN NOW street. END
BEGIN NOW I'll try this one now. END
BEGIN NOW —You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning. END
BEGIN NOW —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. END
BEGIN NOW Get a glass of milk for END
BEGIN NOW yourself and a bun or a something. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be home shortly. END
BEGIN NOW He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on. END
BEGIN NOW The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of END
BEGIN NOW Parkgate. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW The lacquey banged loudly. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing END
BEGIN NOW mincing mouth gently: END
BEGIN NOW —The little nuns! END
BEGIN NOW Nice little things! END
BEGIN NOW O, sure they wouldn't do anything! END
BEGIN NOW O, sure they wouldn't really! END
BEGIN NOW Is it little sister Monica! END
BEGIN NOW From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the END
BEGIN NOW order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, END
BEGIN NOW past Shackleton's offices. END
BEGIN NOW Got round him all right. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Crimmins? END
BEGIN NOW First rate, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid you might be up in your other END
BEGIN NOW establishment in Pimlico. END
BEGIN NOW How are things going? END
BEGIN NOW Just keeping alive. END
BEGIN NOW Lovely weather we're having. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Good for the country. END
BEGIN NOW Those END
BEGIN NOW farmers are always grumbling. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just take a thimbleful of your best END
BEGIN NOW gin, Mr Crimmins. END
BEGIN NOW A small gin, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible affair that END
BEGIN NOW General Slocum explosion. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible, terrible! END
BEGIN NOW A thousand casualties. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW heartrending scenes. END
BEGIN NOW Men trampling down women and children. END
BEGIN NOW Most brutal END
BEGIN NOW thing. END
BEGIN NOW What do they say was the cause? END
BEGIN NOW Spontaneous combustion. END
BEGIN NOW Most END
BEGIN NOW scandalous revelation. END
BEGIN NOW Not a single lifeboat would float and the END
BEGIN NOW firehose all burst. END
BEGIN NOW What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever END
BEGIN NOW allowed a boat like that... END
BEGIN NOW Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. END
BEGIN NOW You know why? END
BEGIN NOW Palm oil. END
BEGIN NOW Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Without a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Well now, look END
BEGIN NOW at that. END
BEGIN NOW And America they say is the land of the free. END
BEGIN NOW I thought we were END
BEGIN NOW bad here. END
BEGIN NOW I smiled at him. END
BEGIN NOW America, I said quietly, just like that. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW The sweepings of every country including our own. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that true? END
BEGIN NOW That's a fact. END
BEGIN NOW Graft, my dear sir. END
BEGIN NOW Well, of course, where there's money going there's END
BEGIN NOW always someone to pick it up. END
BEGIN NOW Saw him looking at my frockcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Dress does it. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing like a dressy END
BEGIN NOW appearance. END
BEGIN NOW Bowls them over. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW How are things? END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter END
BEGIN NOW Kennedy, hairdresser. END
BEGIN NOW Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Scott of Dawson END
BEGIN NOW street. END
BEGIN NOW Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. END
BEGIN NOW Never built END
BEGIN NOW under three guineas. END
BEGIN NOW Fits me down to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Some Kildare street END
BEGIN NOW club toff had it probably. END
BEGIN NOW John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian END
BEGIN NOW bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he END
BEGIN NOW remembered me. END
BEGIN NOW Aham! END
BEGIN NOW Must dress the character for those fellows. END
BEGIN NOW Knight of the road. END
BEGIN NOW Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom END

BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. END
BEGIN NOW High colour, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Grizzled moustache. END
BEGIN NOW Returned Indian officer. END
BEGIN NOW Bravely he bore his stumpy END
BEGIN NOW body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Ned END
BEGIN NOW Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He's as like it as damn END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. END
BEGIN NOW Just a flash END
BEGIN NOW like that. END
BEGIN NOW Damn like him. END
BEGIN NOW Aham! END
BEGIN NOW Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. END
BEGIN NOW Good END
BEGIN NOW drop of gin, that was. END
BEGIN NOW His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his END
BEGIN NOW fat strut. END
BEGIN NOW Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. END
BEGIN NOW Greasy black rope. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife END

BEGIN NOW Bad times those were. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW Over and done with. END
BEGIN NOW Great topers too. END
BEGIN NOW Fourbottle men. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Is he buried in saint Michan's? END
BEGIN NOW Or no, there was a midnight END
BEGIN NOW burial in Glasnevin. END
BEGIN NOW Corpse brought in through a secret door in the END

BEGIN NOW Dignam is there now. END
BEGIN NOW Went out in a puff. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW Better turn END
BEGIN NOW down here. END
BEGIN NOW Make a detour. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the END
BEGIN NOW corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. END
BEGIN NOW Outside the Dublin END
BEGIN NOW Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, END
BEGIN NOW the reins knotted to the wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Damn dangerous thing. END

BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan approached Island street. END
BEGIN NOW Times of the troubles. END
BEGIN NOW Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those END
BEGIN NOW reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. END
BEGIN NOW When you look back on it all now END
BEGIN NOW in a kind of retrospective arrangement. END
BEGIN NOW Gaming at Daly's. END
BEGIN NOW No END
BEGIN NOW cardsharping then. END
BEGIN NOW One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table END
BEGIN NOW by a dagger. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major END
BEGIN NOW Sirr. END
BEGIN NOW Stables behind Moira house. END
BEGIN NOW Damn good gin that was. END
BEGIN NOW Fine dashing young nobleman. END
BEGIN NOW Good stock, of course. END
BEGIN NOW That ruffian, that END
BEGIN NOW sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. END
BEGIN NOW Course they were on END
BEGIN NOW the wrong side. END
BEGIN NOW They rose in dark and evil days. END
BEGIN NOW Fine poem that is: END
BEGIN NOW Ingram. END
BEGIN NOW They were gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard does sing that ballad END
BEGIN NOW touchingly. END
BEGIN NOW Masterly rendition. END
BEGIN NOW At the siege of Ross did my father fall. END
BEGIN NOW A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, END
BEGIN NOW leaping in their, in their saddles. END
BEGIN NOW Frockcoats. END
BEGIN NOW Cream sunshades. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily. END
BEGIN NOW His Excellency! END
BEGIN NOW Too bad! END
BEGIN NOW Just missed that by a hair. END
BEGIN NOW Damn it! END
BEGIN NOW What a END
BEGIN NOW pity! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers END
BEGIN NOW prove a timedulled chain. END
BEGIN NOW Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. END
BEGIN NOW Dust END
BEGIN NOW darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. END
BEGIN NOW Dust slept on END
BEGIN NOW dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, END
BEGIN NOW leprous and winedark stones. END
BEGIN NOW Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights END
BEGIN NOW shining in the darkness. END
BEGIN NOW Where fallen archangels flung the stars of END
BEGIN NOW their brows. END
BEGIN NOW Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. END
BEGIN NOW A sailorman, END
BEGIN NOW rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. END
BEGIN NOW A long and seafed END
BEGIN NOW silent rut. END
BEGIN NOW She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her END
BEGIN NOW hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg. END
BEGIN NOW Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it END
BEGIN NOW and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. END
BEGIN NOW Grandfather ape gloating END
BEGIN NOW on a stolen hoard. END
BEGIN NOW And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? END
BEGIN NOW The brainsick words END
BEGIN NOW of sophists: Antisthenes. END
BEGIN NOW A lore of drugs. END
BEGIN NOW Orient and immortal wheat END
BEGIN NOW standing from everlasting to everlasting. END
BEGIN NOW Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through END
BEGIN NOW Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, END
BEGIN NOW one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled. END
BEGIN NOW The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the END
BEGIN NOW powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. END
BEGIN NOW Beingless beings. END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Throb always END
BEGIN NOW without you and the throb always within. END
BEGIN NOW Your heart you sing of. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW between them. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. END
BEGIN NOW Shatter them, one and both. END
BEGIN NOW But stun myself too in the blow. END
BEGIN NOW Shatter me END
BEGIN NOW you who can. END
BEGIN NOW Bawd and butcher were the words. END
BEGIN NOW I say! END
BEGIN NOW Not yet awhile. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW look around. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, quite true. END
BEGIN NOW Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. END
BEGIN NOW You say END
BEGIN NOW right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against END
BEGIN NOW his shoulderblade. END
BEGIN NOW In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan END
BEGIN NOW boxing Sayers held his eye. END
BEGIN NOW Staring backers with square hats stood round END
BEGIN NOW the roped prizering. END
BEGIN NOW The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed END
BEGIN NOW gently each to other his bulbous fists. END
BEGIN NOW And they are throbbing: heroes' END
BEGIN NOW hearts. END
BEGIN NOW He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart. END
BEGIN NOW —Twopence each, the huckster said. END
BEGIN NOW Four for sixpence. END
BEGIN NOW Tattered pages. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish Beekeeper. END
BEGIN NOW Life and Miracles of the CurÃ© of END
BEGIN NOW Ars. END
BEGIN NOW Pocket Guide to Killarney. END
BEGIN NOW I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. END
BEGIN NOW Stephano Dedalo, alumno END
BEGIN NOW optimo, palmam ferenti. END
BEGIN NOW Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet END
BEGIN NOW of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers. END
BEGIN NOW Binding too good probably. END
BEGIN NOW What is this? END
BEGIN NOW Eighth and ninth book of Moses. END
BEGIN NOW Secret of all secrets. END
BEGIN NOW Seal of King David. END
BEGIN NOW Thumbed pages: read and read. END
BEGIN NOW Who has passed here before me? END
BEGIN NOW How to soften chapped hands. END
BEGIN NOW Recipe for END
BEGIN NOW white wine vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW How to win a woman's love. END
BEGIN NOW For me this. END
BEGIN NOW Say the END
BEGIN NOW following talisman three times with hands folded: END
BEGIN NOW —Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! END
BEGIN NOW Amor me solo! END
BEGIN NOW Sanktus! END
BEGIN NOW Amen. END
BEGIN NOW Who wrote this? END
BEGIN NOW Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter END
BEGIN NOW Salanka to all true believers divulged. END
BEGIN NOW As good as any other abbot's END
BEGIN NOW charms, as mumbling Joachim's. END
BEGIN NOW Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your END
BEGIN NOW wool. END
BEGIN NOW —What are you doing here, Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress. END
BEGIN NOW Shut the book quick. END
BEGIN NOW Don't let see. END
BEGIN NOW —What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. END
BEGIN NOW I told her of END
BEGIN NOW Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a END
BEGIN NOW pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. END
BEGIN NOW Nebrakada femininum. END
BEGIN NOW —What have you there? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen asked. END
BEGIN NOW —I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing END
BEGIN NOW nervously. END
BEGIN NOW Is it any good? END
BEGIN NOW My eyes they say she has. END
BEGIN NOW Do others see me so? END
BEGIN NOW Quick, far and daring. END
BEGIN NOW Shadow of my mind. END
BEGIN NOW He took the coverless book from her hand. END
BEGIN NOW Chardenal's French primer. END
BEGIN NOW —What did you buy that for? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW To learn French? END
BEGIN NOW She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips. END
BEGIN NOW Show no surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Quite natural. END
BEGIN NOW —Here, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW It's all right. END
BEGIN NOW Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose all my books are gone. END
BEGIN NOW —Some, Dilly said. END
BEGIN NOW We had to. END
BEGIN NOW She is drowning. END
BEGIN NOW Agenbite. END
BEGIN NOW Save her. END
BEGIN NOW Agenbite. END
BEGIN NOW All against us. END
BEGIN NOW She will END
BEGIN NOW drown me with her, eyes and hair. END
BEGIN NOW Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, END
BEGIN NOW my heart, my soul. END
BEGIN NOW Salt green death. END
BEGIN NOW We. END
BEGIN NOW Agenbite of inwit. END
BEGIN NOW Inwit's agenbite. END
BEGIN NOW Misery! END
BEGIN NOW Misery! END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW How are things? END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping. END
BEGIN NOW They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. END
BEGIN NOW Father Cowley END
BEGIN NOW brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand. END
BEGIN NOW —What's the best news? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW —Why then not much, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW I'm barricaded up, Simon, with END
BEGIN NOW two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. END
BEGIN NOW —Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Who is it? END
BEGIN NOW —O, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW —With a broken back, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. END
BEGIN NOW Reuben of that ilk. END
BEGIN NOW I'm just END
BEGIN NOW waiting for Ben Dollard. END
BEGIN NOW He's going to say a word to long John to get END
BEGIN NOW him to take those two men off. END
BEGIN NOW All I want is a little time. END
BEGIN NOW He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in END
BEGIN NOW his neck. END
BEGIN NOW —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old bockedy Ben! END
BEGIN NOW He's always END
BEGIN NOW doing a good turn for someone. END
BEGIN NOW Hold hard! END
BEGIN NOW He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant. END
BEGIN NOW —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops END
BEGIN NOW crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. END
BEGIN NOW He came towards END
BEGIN NOW them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails. END
BEGIN NOW As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: END
BEGIN NOW —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. END
BEGIN NOW —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben END
BEGIN NOW Dollard's figure. END
BEGIN NOW Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered END
BEGIN NOW sneeringly: END
BEGIN NOW —That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day? END
BEGIN NOW —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I END
BEGIN NOW threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw. END
BEGIN NOW He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes END
BEGIN NOW from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks be to END
BEGIN NOW God he's not paid yet. END
BEGIN NOW —And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? END
BEGIN NOW Father Cowley asked. END
BEGIN NOW Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, END
BEGIN NOW glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a END
BEGIN NOW deep note. END
BEGIN NOW —Aw! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW —That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone. END
BEGIN NOW —What about that? END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW Not too dusty? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He turned to both. END
BEGIN NOW —That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend Hugh C. END
BEGIN NOW Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint END
BEGIN NOW Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by END
BEGIN NOW Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of END
BEGIN NOW hurdles. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, END
BEGIN NOW his joyful fingers in the air. END
BEGIN NOW —Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I want to show END
BEGIN NOW you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. END
BEGIN NOW He's a cross between END
BEGIN NOW Lobengula and Lynchehaun. END
BEGIN NOW He's well worth seeing, mind you. END
BEGIN NOW Come along. END
BEGIN NOW I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost END
BEGIN NOW me a fall if I don't... END
BEGIN NOW Wait awhile... END
BEGIN NOW We're on the right lay, Bob, END
BEGIN NOW believe you me. END
BEGIN NOW —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously. END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button END
BEGIN NOW of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the END
BEGIN NOW heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. END
BEGIN NOW —What few days? END
BEGIN NOW he boomed. END
BEGIN NOW Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent? END
BEGIN NOW —He has, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW —Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben END
BEGIN NOW Dollard said. END
BEGIN NOW The landlord has the prior claim. END
BEGIN NOW I gave him all the END
BEGIN NOW particulars. END
BEGIN NOW 29 Windsor avenue. END
BEGIN NOW Love is the name? END
BEGIN NOW —That's right, Father Cowley said. END
BEGIN NOW The reverend Mr Love. END
BEGIN NOW He's a minister END
BEGIN NOW in the country somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW But are you sure of that? END
BEGIN NOW —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that END
BEGIN NOW writ where Jacko put the nuts. END
BEGIN NOW He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk. END
BEGIN NOW —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his END
BEGIN NOW glasses on his coatfront, following them. END
BEGIN NOW —The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed END
BEGIN NOW out of the Castleyard gate. END
BEGIN NOW The policeman touched his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW —God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily. END
BEGIN NOW He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on END
BEGIN NOW towards Lord Edward street. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above END
BEGIN NOW the crossblind of the Ormond hotel. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. END
BEGIN NOW I wrote to Father END
BEGIN NOW Conmee and laid the whole case before him. END
BEGIN NOW —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward. END
BEGIN NOW —Boyd? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said shortly. END
BEGIN NOW Touch me not. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them END
BEGIN NOW quickly down Cork hill. END
BEGIN NOW On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed END
BEGIN NOW Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending. END
BEGIN NOW The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street. END
BEGIN NOW —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail END
BEGIN NOW office. END
BEGIN NOW I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings. END
BEGIN NOW —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. END
BEGIN NOW And put down the END
BEGIN NOW five shillings too. END
BEGIN NOW —Without a second word either, Mr Power said. END
BEGIN NOW —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly. END
BEGIN NOW They went down Parliament street. END
BEGIN NOW —There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's. END
BEGIN NOW —Righto, Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW Here goes. END
BEGIN NOW Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in- END
BEGIN NOW law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took END
BEGIN NOW the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked END
BEGIN NOW uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches. END
BEGIN NOW —The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse END
BEGIN NOW Nolan told Mr Power. END
BEGIN NOW They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham, END
BEGIN NOW speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not END
BEGIN NOW glance. END
BEGIN NOW —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as END
BEGIN NOW life. END
BEGIN NOW The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood. END
BEGIN NOW —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and END
BEGIN NOW greeted. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning made no way for them. END
BEGIN NOW He removed his large Henry Clay END
BEGIN NOW decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all END
BEGIN NOW their faces. END
BEGIN NOW —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? END
BEGIN NOW he END
BEGIN NOW said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. END
BEGIN NOW Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, END
BEGIN NOW about their damned Irish language. END
BEGIN NOW Where was the marshal, he wanted to END
BEGIN NOW know, to keep order in the council chamber. END
BEGIN NOW And old Barlow the END
BEGIN NOW macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, END
BEGIN NOW no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little END
BEGIN NOW Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. END
BEGIN NOW Damned Irish language, END
BEGIN NOW language of our forefathers. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the END
BEGIN NOW assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his END
BEGIN NOW peace. END
BEGIN NOW —What Dignam was that? END
BEGIN NOW long John Fanning asked. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot. END
BEGIN NOW —O, my corns! END
BEGIN NOW he said plaintively. END
BEGIN NOW Come upstairs for goodness' sake till END
BEGIN NOW I sit down somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Uff! END
BEGIN NOW Ooo! END
BEGIN NOW Mind! END
BEGIN NOW Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and END
BEGIN NOW passed in and up the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think you END
BEGIN NOW knew him or perhaps you did, though. END
BEGIN NOW With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in. END
BEGIN NOW —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long END
BEGIN NOW John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW —Rather lowsized. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham END
BEGIN NOW said. END
BEGIN NOW Long John Fanning could not remember him. END
BEGIN NOW Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham said. END
BEGIN NOW All turned where they stood. END
BEGIN NOW John Wyse Nolan came down again. END
BEGIN NOW From the END
BEGIN NOW cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, END
BEGIN NOW harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. END
BEGIN NOW Gaily they went past END
BEGIN NOW before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. END
BEGIN NOW In saddles of the leaders, END
BEGIN NOW leaping leaders, rode outriders. END
BEGIN NOW —What was it? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse END
BEGIN NOW Nolan answered from the stairfoot. END
BEGIN NOW As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his END
BEGIN NOW Panama to Haines: END
BEGIN NOW —Parnell's brother. END
BEGIN NOW There in the corner. END
BEGIN NOW They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose END
BEGIN NOW beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that he? END
BEGIN NOW Haines asked, twisting round in his seat. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal. END
BEGIN NOW John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw END
BEGIN NOW went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. END
BEGIN NOW An instant after, under END
BEGIN NOW its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell END
BEGIN NOW once more upon a working corner. END
BEGIN NOW —I'll take a mÃ©lange, Haines said to the waitress. END
BEGIN NOW —Two mÃ©langes, Buck Mulligan said. END
BEGIN NOW And bring us some scones and butter END
BEGIN NOW and some cakes as well. END
BEGIN NOW When she had gone he said, laughing: END
BEGIN NOW —We call it D.B.C. END
BEGIN NOW because they have damn bad cakes. END
BEGIN NOW O, but you missed END
BEGIN NOW Dedalus on Hamlet. END
BEGIN NOW Haines opened his newbought book. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm sorry, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds END
BEGIN NOW that have lost their balance. END
BEGIN NOW The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street: END
BEGIN NOW —England expects... END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. END
BEGIN NOW —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. END
BEGIN NOW Wandering END
BEGIN NOW Ã†ngus I call him. END
BEGIN NOW —I am sure he has an idÃ©e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin END
BEGIN NOW thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. END
BEGIN NOW Now I am speculating what it END
BEGIN NOW would be likely to be. END
BEGIN NOW Such persons always have. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely. END
BEGIN NOW —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. END
BEGIN NOW He will never END
BEGIN NOW capture the Attic note. END
BEGIN NOW The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white END
BEGIN NOW death and the ruddy birth. END
BEGIN NOW That is his tragedy. END
BEGIN NOW He can never be a poet. END
BEGIN NOW The joy of creation... END
BEGIN NOW —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW I tackled him END
BEGIN NOW this morning on belief. END
BEGIN NOW There was something on his mind, I saw. END
BEGIN NOW It's END
BEGIN NOW rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an END
BEGIN NOW interesting point out of that. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. END
BEGIN NOW He helped her to END
BEGIN NOW unload her tray. END
BEGIN NOW —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid END
BEGIN NOW the cheerful cups. END
BEGIN NOW The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, END
BEGIN NOW of retribution. END
BEGIN NOW Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. END
BEGIN NOW Does END
BEGIN NOW he write anything for your movement? END
BEGIN NOW He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its END
BEGIN NOW smoking pith. END
BEGIN NOW He bit off a soft piece hungrily. END
BEGIN NOW —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. END
BEGIN NOW He is going to write END
BEGIN NOW something in ten years. END
BEGIN NOW —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all. END
BEGIN NOW He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. END
BEGIN NOW —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. END
BEGIN NOW I don't END
BEGIN NOW want to be imposed on. END
BEGIN NOW Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of END
BEGIN NOW ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping END
BEGIN NOW street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean END
BEGIN NOW from Bridgwater with bricks. END
BEGIN NOW Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. END
BEGIN NOW Behind END
BEGIN NOW him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with END
BEGIN NOW stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's END
BEGIN NOW house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. END
BEGIN NOW Distantly behind him a END
BEGIN NOW blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park. END
BEGIN NOW Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr END
BEGIN NOW Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along END
BEGIN NOW Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling. END
BEGIN NOW At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name END
BEGIN NOW announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of END
BEGIN NOW duke's lawn. END
BEGIN NOW His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW With ratsteeth END
BEGIN NOW bared he muttered: END
BEGIN NOW —Coactus volui. END
BEGIN NOW He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word. END
BEGIN NOW As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat END
BEGIN NOW brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, END
BEGIN NOW having buffeted a thewless body. END
BEGIN NOW The blind stripling turned his sickly END
BEGIN NOW face after the striding form. END
BEGIN NOW —God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! END
BEGIN NOW You're blinder nor END
BEGIN NOW I am, you bitch's bastard! END
BEGIN NOW Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the END
BEGIN NOW pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been END
BEGIN NOW sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. END
BEGIN NOW It was too blooming END
BEGIN NOW dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs END
BEGIN NOW MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping END
BEGIN NOW sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. END
BEGIN NOW And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole END
BEGIN NOW blooming time and sighing. END
BEGIN NOW After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, END
BEGIN NOW stopped him. END
BEGIN NOW He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their END
BEGIN NOW pelts and putting up their props. END
BEGIN NOW From the sidemirrors two mourning END
BEGIN NOW Masters Dignam gaped silently. END
BEGIN NOW Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet END
BEGIN NOW sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty END
BEGIN NOW sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. END
BEGIN NOW Myler Keogh, END
BEGIN NOW that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. END
BEGIN NOW Two bar END
BEGIN NOW entrance, soldiers half price. END
BEGIN NOW I could easy do a bunk on ma. END
BEGIN NOW Master END
BEGIN NOW Dignam on his left turned as he turned. END
BEGIN NOW That's me in mourning. END
BEGIN NOW When is END
BEGIN NOW it? END
BEGIN NOW May the twentysecond. END
BEGIN NOW Sure, the blooming thing is all over. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, END
BEGIN NOW his collar sticking up. END
BEGIN NOW Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the END
BEGIN NOW image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. END
BEGIN NOW One END
BEGIN NOW of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old END
BEGIN NOW fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out. END
BEGIN NOW Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. END
BEGIN NOW The best pucker going END
BEGIN NOW for strength was Fitzsimons. END
BEGIN NOW One puck in the wind from that fellow would END
BEGIN NOW knock you into the middle of next week, man. END
BEGIN NOW But the best pucker for END
BEGIN NOW science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of END
BEGIN NOW him, dodging and all. END
BEGIN NOW In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a END
BEGIN NOW swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was END
BEGIN NOW telling him and grinning all the time. END
BEGIN NOW No Sandymount tram. END
BEGIN NOW Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his END
BEGIN NOW other hand. END
BEGIN NOW His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming END
BEGIN NOW end to it. END
BEGIN NOW He met schoolboys with satchels. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not going tomorrow END
BEGIN NOW either, stay away till Monday. END
BEGIN NOW He met other schoolboys. END
BEGIN NOW Do they notice END
BEGIN NOW I'm in mourning? END
BEGIN NOW Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's END
BEGIN NOW name. END
BEGIN NOW His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a END
BEGIN NOW fly walking over it up to his eye. END
BEGIN NOW The scrunch that was when they were END
BEGIN NOW screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were END
BEGIN NOW bringing it downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling END
BEGIN NOW the men how to get it round the bend. END
BEGIN NOW A big coffin it was, and high and END
BEGIN NOW heavylooking. END
BEGIN NOW How was that? END
BEGIN NOW The last night pa was boosed he was standing END
BEGIN NOW on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for END
BEGIN NOW to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Never see him END
BEGIN NOW again. END
BEGIN NOW Death, that is. END
BEGIN NOW Pa is dead. END
BEGIN NOW My father is dead. END
BEGIN NOW He told me to be a END
BEGIN NOW good son to ma. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his END

BEGIN NOW Poor pa. END
BEGIN NOW That was Mr END
BEGIN NOW Dignam, my father. END
BEGIN NOW I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to END

BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: END

BEGIN NOW Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears END
BEGIN NOW with little fingers. END

BEGIN NOW But Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone: END

BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed END
BEGIN NOW again: END
BEGIN NOW —Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. END
BEGIN NOW The hideous old wretch! END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW night in the Antient Concert Rooms. END
BEGIN NOW She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea. END

BEGIN NOW Hufa! END
BEGIN NOW Hufa! END
BEGIN NOW Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce END

BEGIN NOW —O! END
BEGIN NOW shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. END
BEGIN NOW Will you ever forget his goggle eye? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: END
BEGIN NOW —And your other eye! END
BEGIN NOW Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. END
BEGIN NOW Why do I always think END

BEGIN NOW Gathering figs, I think. END

BEGIN NOW Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW Chips, picking chips off one of his END

BEGIN NOW Chips. END
BEGIN NOW He strolled. END
BEGIN NOW —O, welcome back, miss Douce. END
BEGIN NOW He held her hand. END
BEGIN NOW Enjoyed her holidays? END
BEGIN NOW —Tiptop. END
BEGIN NOW He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor. END
BEGIN NOW —Gorgeous, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the holy show I am. END
BEGIN NOW Lying out on the strand END
BEGIN NOW all day. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze whiteness. END
BEGIN NOW —That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed END
BEGIN NOW her hand indulgently. END
BEGIN NOW Tempting poor simple males. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away. END
BEGIN NOW —O go away! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW You're very simple, I don't think. END
BEGIN NOW He was. END
BEGIN NOW —Well now I am, he mused. END
BEGIN NOW I looked so simple in the cradle they END
BEGIN NOW christened me simple Simon. END
BEGIN NOW —You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. END
BEGIN NOW And what did the END
BEGIN NOW doctor order today? END
BEGIN NOW —Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. END
BEGIN NOW I think I'll trouble you END
BEGIN NOW for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle. END
BEGIN NOW —With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed. END
BEGIN NOW With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's END
BEGIN NOW she turned herself. END
BEGIN NOW With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from END
BEGIN NOW her crystal keg. END
BEGIN NOW Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought END
BEGIN NOW pouch and pipe. END
BEGIN NOW Alacrity she served. END
BEGIN NOW He blew through the flue two husky END
BEGIN NOW fifenotes. END
BEGIN NOW —By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. END
BEGIN NOW Must be END
BEGIN NOW a great tonic in the air down there. END
BEGIN NOW But a long threatening comes at END
BEGIN NOW last, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the END
BEGIN NOW bowl. END
BEGIN NOW Chips. END
BEGIN NOW Shreds. END
BEGIN NOW Musing. END
BEGIN NOW Mute. END
BEGIN NOW None nought said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: END
BEGIN NOW —O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! END
BEGIN NOW —Was Mr Lidwell in today? END
BEGIN NOW In came Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Round him peered Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom reached Essex END
BEGIN NOW bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. END
BEGIN NOW To Martha I must write. END
BEGIN NOW Buy paper. END
BEGIN NOW Daly's. END

BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Old Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Blue bloom is on END
BEGIN NOW the rye. END
BEGIN NOW —He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan came forward. END
BEGIN NOW —Was Mr Boylan looking for me? END
BEGIN NOW He asked. END
BEGIN NOW She answered: END
BEGIN NOW —Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs? END
BEGIN NOW She asked. END
BEGIN NOW Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her END
BEGIN NOW gaze upon a page: END
BEGIN NOW —No. END
BEGIN NOW He was not. END
BEGIN NOW Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan round the END
BEGIN NOW sandwichbell wound his round body round. END
BEGIN NOW —Peep! END
BEGIN NOW Who's in the corner? END
BEGIN NOW No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. END
BEGIN NOW To mind her END
BEGIN NOW stops. END
BEGIN NOW To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle jaunty jingle. END
BEGIN NOW Girlgold she read and did not glance. END
BEGIN NOW Take no notice. END
BEGIN NOW She took no notice END
BEGIN NOW while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: END
BEGIN NOW —Ah fox met ah stork. END
BEGIN NOW Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your END
BEGIN NOW bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone? END
BEGIN NOW He droned in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce turned to her tea aside. END
BEGIN NOW He sighed aside: END
BEGIN NOW —Ah me! END
BEGIN NOW O my! END
BEGIN NOW He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod. END
BEGIN NOW —Greetings from the famous son of a famous father. END
BEGIN NOW —Who may he be? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus asked. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan opened most genial arms. END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW —Who may he be? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Can you ask? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, the youthful bard. END
BEGIN NOW Dry. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe. END
BEGIN NOW —I see, he said. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't recognise him for the moment. END
BEGIN NOW I hear he is END
BEGIN NOW keeping very select company. END
BEGIN NOW Have you seen him lately? END
BEGIN NOW He had. END
BEGIN NOW —I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW In END
BEGIN NOW Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. END
BEGIN NOW He had received the rhino for END
BEGIN NOW the labour of his muse. END
BEGIN NOW He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: END
BEGIN NOW —The Ã©lite of Erin hung upon his lips. END
BEGIN NOW The ponderous pundit, Hugh END
BEGIN NOW MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy END
BEGIN NOW of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the END
BEGIN NOW O'Madden Burke. END
BEGIN NOW After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and END
BEGIN NOW —That must have been highly diverting, said he. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW He see. END
BEGIN NOW He drank. END
BEGIN NOW With faraway mourning mountain eye. END
BEGIN NOW Set down his END
BEGIN NOW glass. END
BEGIN NOW He looked towards the saloon door. END
BEGIN NOW —I see you have moved the piano. END
BEGIN NOW —The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking END
BEGIN NOW concert and I never heard such an exquisite player. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW —Didn't he, miss Kennedy? END
BEGIN NOW The real classical, you know. END
BEGIN NOW And blind too, END
BEGIN NOW poor fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Not twenty I'm sure he was. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that a fact? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW He drank and strayed away. END
BEGIN NOW —So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled. END
BEGIN NOW God's curse on bitch's bastard. END
BEGIN NOW Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. END
BEGIN NOW To the door of the bar and END
BEGIN NOW diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. END
BEGIN NOW Lager for diner. END
BEGIN NOW Lager without alacrity she served. END
BEGIN NOW With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for END
BEGIN NOW jinglejaunty blazes boy. END
BEGIN NOW Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique END
BEGIN NOW triple (piano!) wires. END
BEGIN NOW He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her END
BEGIN NOW hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt END
BEGIN NOW advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action. END
BEGIN NOW Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. END
BEGIN NOW Are you not END
BEGIN NOW happy in your home? END
BEGIN NOW Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. END
BEGIN NOW Means END
BEGIN NOW something, language of flow. END
BEGIN NOW Was it a daisy? END
BEGIN NOW Innocence that is. END
BEGIN NOW Respectable girl meet after mass. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks awfully muchly. END
BEGIN NOW Wise Bloom eyed END
BEGIN NOW on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. END
BEGIN NOW Smoke END
BEGIN NOW mermaids, coolest whiff of all. END
BEGIN NOW Hair streaming: lovelorn. END
BEGIN NOW For some man. END
BEGIN NOW For Raoul. END
BEGIN NOW He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a END
BEGIN NOW jaunting car. END
BEGIN NOW It is. END
BEGIN NOW Again. END
BEGIN NOW Third time. END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. END
BEGIN NOW Follow. END
BEGIN NOW Risk it. END
BEGIN NOW Go quick. END
BEGIN NOW At four. END
BEGIN NOW Near now. END
BEGIN NOW Out. END
BEGIN NOW —Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say. END
BEGIN NOW —Aha... END
BEGIN NOW I was forgetting... END
BEGIN NOW Excuse... END
BEGIN NOW —And four. END
BEGIN NOW At four she. END
BEGIN NOW Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. END
BEGIN NOW Bloo smi qui go. END
BEGIN NOW Ternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Think you're the only pebble on the beach? END
BEGIN NOW Does that to all. END
BEGIN NOW For men. END
BEGIN NOW In drowsy silence gold bent on her page. END
BEGIN NOW From the saloon a call came, long in dying. END
BEGIN NOW That was a tuningfork the END
BEGIN NOW tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. END
BEGIN NOW A call again. END
BEGIN NOW That he now END
BEGIN NOW poised that it now throbbed. END
BEGIN NOW You hear? END
BEGIN NOW It throbbed, pure, purer, softly END
BEGIN NOW and softlier, its buzzing prongs. END
BEGIN NOW Longer in dying call. END
BEGIN NOW Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and END
BEGIN NOW popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss END
BEGIN NOW Douce. END
BEGIN NOW —The bright stars fade... END
BEGIN NOW A voiceless song sang from within, singing: END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW the morn is breaking. END
BEGIN NOW A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive END
BEGIN NOW hands. END
BEGIN NOW Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, END
BEGIN NOW called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's END
BEGIN NOW leavetaking, life's, love's morn. END
BEGIN NOW —The dewdrops pearl... END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy. END
BEGIN NOW —But look this way, he said, rose of Castile. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped. END
BEGIN NOW She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, END
BEGIN NOW dreamily rose. END
BEGIN NOW —Did she fall or was she pushed? END
BEGIN NOW he asked her. END
BEGIN NOW She answered, slighting: END
BEGIN NOW —Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies. END
BEGIN NOW Like lady, ladylike. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan heard and knew and END
BEGIN NOW hailed him: END
BEGIN NOW —See the conquering hero comes. END
BEGIN NOW Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered END
BEGIN NOW hero. END
BEGIN NOW See me he might. END
BEGIN NOW The seat he sat on: warm. END
BEGIN NOW Black wary hecat walked END
BEGIN NOW towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting. END
BEGIN NOW —And I from thee... END
BEGIN NOW —I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. END
BEGIN NOW She smiled END
BEGIN NOW on him. END
BEGIN NOW But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer END
BEGIN NOW hair, a bosom and a rose. END
BEGIN NOW Smart Boylan bespoke potions. END
BEGIN NOW —What's your cry? END
BEGIN NOW Glass of bitter? END
BEGIN NOW Glass of bitter, please, and a END
BEGIN NOW sloegin for me. END
BEGIN NOW Wire in yet? END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW At four she. END
BEGIN NOW Who said four? END
BEGIN NOW Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office. END
BEGIN NOW Avoid. END
BEGIN NOW Goulding a chance. END
BEGIN NOW What is he doing in the Ormond? END
BEGIN NOW Car waiting. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. END
BEGIN NOW Where off to? END
BEGIN NOW Something to eat? END
BEGIN NOW I too was just. END
BEGIN NOW In here. END
BEGIN NOW What, END
BEGIN NOW Ormond? END
BEGIN NOW Best value in Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Is that so? END
BEGIN NOW Diningroom. END
BEGIN NOW Sit tight there. END
BEGIN NOW See, not be seen. END
BEGIN NOW I think I'll join you. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Richie led on. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom END
BEGIN NOW followed bag. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner fit for a prince. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her END
BEGIN NOW bust, that all but burst, so high. END
BEGIN NOW —O! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph. END
BEGIN NOW —Why don't you grow? END
BEGIN NOW asked Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his END
BEGIN NOW lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and END
BEGIN NOW syrupped with her voice: END
BEGIN NOW —Fine goods in small parcels. END
BEGIN NOW That is to say she. END
BEGIN NOW Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe. END
BEGIN NOW —Here's fortune, Blazes said. END
BEGIN NOW He pitched a broad coin down. END
BEGIN NOW Coin rang. END
BEGIN NOW —Hold on, said Lenehan, till I... END
BEGIN NOW —Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale. END
BEGIN NOW —Sceptre will win in a canter, he said. END
BEGIN NOW —I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. END
BEGIN NOW Not on my own, you END
BEGIN NOW know. END
BEGIN NOW Fancy of a friend of mine. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's END
BEGIN NOW lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled. END
BEGIN NOW Idolores. END
BEGIN NOW The eastern seas. END
BEGIN NOW Clock whirred. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), END
BEGIN NOW bearing away teatray. END
BEGIN NOW Clock clacked. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW clanged. END
BEGIN NOW Clock clacked. END
BEGIN NOW Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till END
BEGIN NOW and hummed and handed coins in change. END
BEGIN NOW Look to the west. END
BEGIN NOW A clack. END
BEGIN NOW For END
BEGIN NOW me. END
BEGIN NOW —What time is that? END
BEGIN NOW asked Blazes Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW Four? END
BEGIN NOW O'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes END
BEGIN NOW Boylan's elbowsleeve. END
BEGIN NOW —Let's hear the time, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. END
BEGIN NOW Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the END
BEGIN NOW door. END
BEGIN NOW Be near. END
BEGIN NOW At four. END
BEGIN NOW Has he forgotten? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a trick. END
BEGIN NOW Not come: END
BEGIN NOW whet appetite. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't do. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, wait. END
BEGIN NOW Pat, waiter, waited. END
BEGIN NOW Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —Go on, pressed Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one. END
BEGIN NOW He never heard. END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW to Flora's lips did hie. END
BEGIN NOW High, a high note pealed in the treble clear. END
BEGIN NOW Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought END
BEGIN NOW Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —Please, please. END
BEGIN NOW He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal. END
BEGIN NOW —I could not leave thee... END
BEGIN NOW —Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly. END
BEGIN NOW —No, now, urged Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Sonnezlacloche! END
BEGIN NOW O do! END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one. END
BEGIN NOW She looked. END
BEGIN NOW Quick. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Kenn out of earshot. END
BEGIN NOW Sudden bent. END
BEGIN NOW Two kindling END
BEGIN NOW faces watched her bend. END
BEGIN NOW Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, END
BEGIN NOW and lost and found it, faltering. END
BEGIN NOW —Go on! END
BEGIN NOW Do! END
BEGIN NOW Sonnez! END
BEGIN NOW Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. END
BEGIN NOW Delayed. END
BEGIN NOW Taunted END
BEGIN NOW them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —Sonnez! END
BEGIN NOW Smack. END
BEGIN NOW She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter END
BEGIN NOW smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh. END
BEGIN NOW —La Cloche! END
BEGIN NOW cried gleeful Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Trained by owner. END
BEGIN NOW No sawdust there. END
BEGIN NOW She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! END
BEGIN NOW aren't men?), but, lightward END
BEGIN NOW gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW —You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said. END
BEGIN NOW Boylan, eyed, eyed. END
BEGIN NOW Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his END
BEGIN NOW chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. END
BEGIN NOW His spellbound END
BEGIN NOW eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by END
BEGIN NOW mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, END
BEGIN NOW a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bronze from anearby. END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW Sweetheart, goodbye! END
BEGIN NOW —I'm off, said Boylan with impatience. END
BEGIN NOW He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change. END
BEGIN NOW —Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Tom Rochford... END
BEGIN NOW —Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going. END
BEGIN NOW Lenehan gulped to go. END
BEGIN NOW —Got the horn or what? END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming. END
BEGIN NOW He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the END
BEGIN NOW threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender. END
BEGIN NOW —How do you do, Mr Dollard? END
BEGIN NOW —Eh? END
BEGIN NOW How do? END
BEGIN NOW How do? END
BEGIN NOW Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an END
BEGIN NOW instant from Father Cowley's woe. END
BEGIN NOW He won't give you any trouble, Bob. END
BEGIN NOW Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. END
BEGIN NOW We'll put a barleystraw in END
BEGIN NOW that Judas Iscariot's ear this time. END
BEGIN NOW Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid. END
BEGIN NOW —Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Simon. END
BEGIN NOW Give us a END
BEGIN NOW ditty. END
BEGIN NOW We heard the piano. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. END
BEGIN NOW Power for Richie. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Let me see. END
BEGIN NOW Not make him walk twice. END
BEGIN NOW His corns. END
BEGIN NOW Four now. END
BEGIN NOW How END
BEGIN NOW warm this black is. END
BEGIN NOW Course nerves a bit. END
BEGIN NOW Refracts (is it?) heat. END
BEGIN NOW Let me END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW Cider. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, bottle of cider. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW I was only vamping, man. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. END
BEGIN NOW Begone dull care. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Bob. END
BEGIN NOW He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: END
BEGIN NOW hold him now) into the saloon. END
BEGIN NOW He plumped him Dollard on the stool. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW gouty paws plumped chords. END
BEGIN NOW Plumped, stopped abrupt. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. END
BEGIN NOW Bothered, he wanted END
BEGIN NOW Power and cider. END
BEGIN NOW Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle a tinkle jaunted. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. END
BEGIN NOW He's off. END
BEGIN NOW Light sob of breath Bloom END
BEGIN NOW sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Jingling. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone. END
BEGIN NOW Jingle. END
BEGIN NOW Hear. END
BEGIN NOW —Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW God be with old times. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten END
BEGIN NOW by sunlight. END
BEGIN NOW Gone. END
BEGIN NOW Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), END
BEGIN NOW she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. END
BEGIN NOW She drew down pensive END
BEGIN NOW (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where END
BEGIN NOW bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite END
BEGIN NOW nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de END
BEGIN NOW Nil. END
BEGIN NOW —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the END
BEGIN NOW Collard grand. END
BEGIN NOW There was. END
BEGIN NOW —A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW The devil wouldn't stop him. END
BEGIN NOW He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink. END
BEGIN NOW —God, do you remember? END
BEGIN NOW Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished END
BEGIN NOW keyboard. END
BEGIN NOW And by Japers I had no wedding garment. END
BEGIN NOW They laughed all three. END
BEGIN NOW He had no wed. END
BEGIN NOW All trio laughed. END
BEGIN NOW No wedding END
BEGIN NOW garment. END
BEGIN NOW —Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. END
BEGIN NOW Where's END
BEGIN NOW my pipe, by the way? END
BEGIN NOW He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. END
BEGIN NOW Bald Pat carried two END
BEGIN NOW diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. END
BEGIN NOW And Father Cowley laughed again. END
BEGIN NOW —I saved the situation, Ben, I think. END
BEGIN NOW —You did, averred Ben Dollard. END
BEGIN NOW I remember those tight trousers too. END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW was a brilliant idea, Bob. END
BEGIN NOW Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. END
BEGIN NOW He saved the situa. END
BEGIN NOW Tight trou. END
BEGIN NOW Brilliant ide. END
BEGIN NOW —I knew he was on the rocks, he said. END
BEGIN NOW The wife was playing the piano in END

BEGIN NOW Lovely maidens sit in close END

BEGIN NOW while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden END
BEGIN NOW ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, END

BEGIN NOW And heroes END
BEGIN NOW voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless END
BEGIN NOW princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth END
BEGIN NOW sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of END
BEGIN NOW the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings. END
BEGIN NOW And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen END
BEGIN NOW by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for END
BEGIN NOW that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of END
BEGIN NOW that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain END
BEGIN NOW descended from chieftains. END
BEGIN NOW Thither the extremely large wains bring END
BEGIN NOW foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, END
BEGIN NOW pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, END
BEGIN NOW drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, END

BEGIN NOW mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red END
BEGIN NOW green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and END
BEGIN NOW chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, END
BEGIN NOW and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. END
BEGIN NOW I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. END
BEGIN NOW Come out here, Geraghty, you END
BEGIN NOW notorious bloody hill and dale robber! END
BEGIN NOW And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed END
BEGIN NOW ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers END
BEGIN NOW and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and END
BEGIN NOW Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the END
BEGIN NOW various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus END
BEGIN NOW heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime END
BEGIN NOW premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, END
BEGIN NOW cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, END
BEGIN NOW champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from END
BEGIN NOW pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy END
BEGIN NOW vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and END

BEGIN NOW milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and END
BEGIN NOW targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, END
BEGIN NOW various in size, the agate with this dun. END
BEGIN NOW So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the END
BEGIN NOW citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that END
BEGIN NOW bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would END
BEGIN NOW drop in the way of drink. END
BEGIN NOW —There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his END
BEGIN NOW load of papers, working for the cause. END
BEGIN NOW The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. END
BEGIN NOW Be END
BEGIN NOW a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody END

BEGIN NOW I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a END

BEGIN NOW about a licence. END
BEGIN NOW —Stand and deliver, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —That's all right, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Friends here. END
BEGIN NOW —Pass, friends, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: END
BEGIN NOW —What's your opinion of the times? END
BEGIN NOW Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. END
BEGIN NOW But, begob, Joe was equal to END
BEGIN NOW the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his END
BEGIN NOW fork. END
BEGIN NOW So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: END
BEGIN NOW —Foreign wars is the cause of it. END
BEGIN NOW And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: END
BEGIN NOW —It's the Russians wish to tyrannise. END
BEGIN NOW —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW I've a thirst on me END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't sell for half a crown. END
BEGIN NOW —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Wine of the country, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —What's yours? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Ditto MacAnaspey, says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Three pints, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And how's the old heart, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW says END
BEGIN NOW he. END
BEGIN NOW —Never better, a chara, says he. END
BEGIN NOW What Garry? END
BEGIN NOW Are we going to win? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck END
BEGIN NOW and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. END
BEGIN NOW The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was END
BEGIN NOW that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired END
BEGIN NOW freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded END
BEGIN NOW deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed END
BEGIN NOW hero. END
BEGIN NOW From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his END
BEGIN NOW rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his END
BEGIN NOW body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue END
BEGIN NOW and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue END
BEGIN NOW projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous END
BEGIN NOW obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes in END
BEGIN NOW which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the END
BEGIN NOW dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW A powerful current of warm breath END
BEGIN NOW issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while END
BEGIN NOW in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his END
BEGIN NOW formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of END
BEGIN NOW the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and END
BEGIN NOW tremble. END
BEGIN NOW He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to END
BEGIN NOW the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a END
BEGIN NOW girdle of plaited straw and rushes. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath this he wore trews of END
BEGIN NOW deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. END
BEGIN NOW His nether extremities were encased END
BEGIN NOW in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod END
BEGIN NOW with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same END
BEGIN NOW beast. END
BEGIN NOW From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every END
BEGIN NOW movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet END
BEGIN NOW striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of END

BEGIN NOW A couched spear of END

BEGIN NOW animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was END
BEGIN NOW sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and END
BEGIN NOW spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by END
BEGIN NOW tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of END
BEGIN NOW paleolithic stone. END
BEGIN NOW So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the END
BEGIN NOW sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as END
BEGIN NOW I'm telling you. END
BEGIN NOW A goodlooking sovereign. END
BEGIN NOW —And there's more where that came from, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Sweat of my brow, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas the prudent member gave me the END
BEGIN NOW wheeze. END
BEGIN NOW —I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and END
BEGIN NOW Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish. END
BEGIN NOW Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? END
BEGIN NOW O'Bloom, the END
BEGIN NOW son of Rory: it is he. END
BEGIN NOW Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the END
BEGIN NOW prudent soul. END
BEGIN NOW —For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised END
BEGIN NOW organ. END
BEGIN NOW The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. END
BEGIN NOW And look at this END
BEGIN NOW blasted rag, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Look at this, says he. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish Independent, if END
BEGIN NOW you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. END
BEGIN NOW Listen to END
BEGIN NOW the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll END
BEGIN NOW thank you and the marriages. END
BEGIN NOW And he starts reading them out: END
BEGIN NOW —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on END
BEGIN NOW Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. END
BEGIN NOW How's that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Wright and END
BEGIN NOW Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late END

BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Deaths. END
BEGIN NOW Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, END
BEGIN NOW Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat END
BEGIN NOW house, Chepstow... END
BEGIN NOW —I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience. END
BEGIN NOW —Cockburn. END
BEGIN NOW Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, END
BEGIN NOW Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, END
BEGIN NOW Liverpool, Isabella Helen. END
BEGIN NOW How's that for a national press, eh, my brown END
BEGIN NOW son! END
BEGIN NOW How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber? END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks be to God they had END
BEGIN NOW the start of us. END
BEGIN NOW Drink that, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —I will, says he, honourable person. END
BEGIN NOW —Health, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW And all down the form. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Ow! END
BEGIN NOW Don't be talking! END
BEGIN NOW I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click. END
BEGIN NOW And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came END
BEGIN NOW swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him END
BEGIN NOW there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred END
BEGIN NOW scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, END
BEGIN NOW fairest of her race. END
BEGIN NOW Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, END
BEGIN NOW squeezed up with the laughing. END
BEGIN NOW And who was sitting up there in the END
BEGIN NOW corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob END
BEGIN NOW Doran. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the END
BEGIN NOW door. END
BEGIN NOW And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen END
BEGIN NOW in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and END
BEGIN NOW the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a END
BEGIN NOW poodle. END
BEGIN NOW I thought Alf would split. END
BEGIN NOW —Look at him, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Breen. END
BEGIN NOW He's traipsing all round Dublin with a END
BEGIN NOW postcard someone sent him with U. END
BEGIN NOW p: up on it to take a li... END
BEGIN NOW And he doubled up. END
BEGIN NOW —Take a what? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW —O hell! END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you END
BEGIN NOW seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs. END
BEGIN NOW —Bi i dho husht, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Breen, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round END
BEGIN NOW to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to END
BEGIN NOW the subsheriff's for a lark. END
BEGIN NOW O God, I've a pain laughing. END
BEGIN NOW U. END
BEGIN NOW p: up. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old END
BEGIN NOW lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man. END
BEGIN NOW —When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Alf Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging? END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I show you. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Terry, give us a END
BEGIN NOW pony. END
BEGIN NOW That bloody old fool! END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW You should have seen END
BEGIN NOW long John's eye. END
BEGIN NOW U. END
BEGIN NOW p... END
BEGIN NOW And he started laughing. END
BEGIN NOW —Who are you laughing at? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full END
BEGIN NOW of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and END
BEGIN NOW Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of END
BEGIN NOW deathless Leda. END
BEGIN NOW For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and END
BEGIN NOW mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour END
BEGIN NOW juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day END
BEGIN NOW from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat. END
BEGIN NOW Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, END
BEGIN NOW that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that END
BEGIN NOW thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals. END
BEGIN NOW But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone END
BEGIN NOW in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of END
BEGIN NOW costliest bronze. END
BEGIN NOW Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the END
BEGIN NOW image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, END
BEGIN NOW Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the END
BEGIN NOW United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions END
BEGIN NOW beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even END
BEGIN NOW she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for END
BEGIN NOW they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down END
BEGIN NOW thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and END
BEGIN NOW down outside? END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. END
BEGIN NOW Talking about hanging, END
BEGIN NOW I'll show you something you never saw. END
BEGIN NOW Hangmen's letters. END
BEGIN NOW Look at here. END
BEGIN NOW So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you codding? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Honest injun, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Read them. END
BEGIN NOW So Joe took up the letters. END
BEGIN NOW —Who are you laughing at? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when END
BEGIN NOW the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk: END
BEGIN NOW —How's Willy Murray those times, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW —I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy END
BEGIN NOW Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Only I was running after that... END
BEGIN NOW —You what? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe, throwing down the letters. END
BEGIN NOW With who? END
BEGIN NOW —With Dignam, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Is it Paddy? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW —Don't you know he's dead? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Paddy Dignam dead! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a END
BEGIN NOW pikestaff. END
BEGIN NOW —Who's dead? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW —You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Good Christ, only five... END
BEGIN NOW What?... END
BEGIN NOW And Willy Murray END
BEGIN NOW with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Dignam END
BEGIN NOW dead? END
BEGIN NOW —What about Dignam? END
BEGIN NOW says Bob Doran. END
BEGIN NOW Who's talking about...? END
BEGIN NOW —Dead! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He's no more dead than you are. END
BEGIN NOW —Maybe so, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW They took the liberty of burying him this morning END
BEGIN NOW anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW —Paddy? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him. END
BEGIN NOW —Good Christ! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. END
BEGIN NOW In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by END
BEGIN NOW tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing END
BEGIN NOW luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the END
BEGIN NOW etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of END
BEGIN NOW jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. END
BEGIN NOW Communication was END
BEGIN NOW effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery END
BEGIN NOW and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. END
BEGIN NOW Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he END
BEGIN NOW stated that he was now on the path of prÄlÄyÄ or return but was still END
BEGIN NOW submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the END
BEGIN NOW lower astral levels. END
BEGIN NOW In reply to a question as to his first sensations END
BEGIN NOW in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a END
BEGIN NOW glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities END
BEGIN NOW of atmic development opened up to them. END
BEGIN NOW Interrogated as to whether life END
BEGIN NOW there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard END
BEGIN NOW from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were END
BEGIN NOW equipped with every modern home comfort such as tÄlÄfÄnÄ, END
BEGIN NOW ÄlÄvÄtÄr, hÄtÄkÄldÄ, wÄtÄklÄsÄt and that the highest adepts END
BEGIN NOW were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. END
BEGIN NOW Having END
BEGIN NOW requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded END
BEGIN NOW relief. END
BEGIN NOW Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who END
BEGIN NOW were still at the wrong side of MÄyÄ to acknowledge the true path for END
BEGIN NOW it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for END
BEGIN NOW mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. END
BEGIN NOW It was then END
BEGIN NOW queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the END
BEGIN NOW defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still END
BEGIN NOW in the body. END
BEGIN NOW Mind C. END
BEGIN NOW K. END
BEGIN NOW doesn't pile it on. END
BEGIN NOW It was ascertained that the END
BEGIN NOW reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the END
BEGIN NOW defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment END
BEGIN NOW arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW Before departing he requested that it should be told to END
BEGIN NOW his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was END
BEGIN NOW at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should END
BEGIN NOW be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other END
BEGIN NOW region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. END
BEGIN NOW Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was END
BEGIN NOW intimated that this had given satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. END
BEGIN NOW Fleet was END
BEGIN NOW his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. END
BEGIN NOW Wail, Banba, with END
BEGIN NOW your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind. END
BEGIN NOW —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out. END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Bloom, says he. END
BEGIN NOW He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten END
BEGIN NOW minutes. END
BEGIN NOW And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again. END
BEGIN NOW Little Alf was knocked bawways. END
BEGIN NOW Faith, he was. END
BEGIN NOW —Good Christ! END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW I could have sworn it was him. END
BEGIN NOW And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest END
BEGIN NOW blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence: END
BEGIN NOW —Who said Christ is good? END
BEGIN NOW —I beg your parsnips, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy END
BEGIN NOW Dignam? END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. END
BEGIN NOW He's over all his troubles. END
BEGIN NOW But Bob Doran shouts out of him. END
BEGIN NOW —He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't END
BEGIN NOW want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. END
BEGIN NOW And Bob Doran END
BEGIN NOW starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there. END
BEGIN NOW —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character. END
BEGIN NOW The tear is bloody near your eye. END
BEGIN NOW Talking through his bloody hat. END
BEGIN NOW Fitter END
BEGIN NOW for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the END
BEGIN NOW bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used END
BEGIN NOW to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was END
BEGIN NOW stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing END
BEGIN NOW her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour. END
BEGIN NOW —The noblest, the truest, says he. END
BEGIN NOW And he's gone, poor little Willy, END
BEGIN NOW poor little Paddy Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that END
BEGIN NOW beam of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round END
BEGIN NOW the door. END
BEGIN NOW —Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham there. END
BEGIN NOW —O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. END
BEGIN NOW Listen to END
BEGIN NOW this, will you? END
BEGIN NOW And he starts reading out one. END
BEGIN NOW 7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. END
BEGIN NOW To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful END
BEGIN NOW case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i END
BEGIN NOW hanged... END
BEGIN NOW —Show us, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in END
BEGIN NOW Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... END
BEGIN NOW —Jesus, says I. END
BEGIN NOW —... END
BEGIN NOW Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... END
BEGIN NOW The citizen made a grab at the letter. END
BEGIN NOW —Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in END
BEGIN NOW he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms END
BEGIN NOW is five ginnees. END
BEGIN NOW H. END
BEGIN NOW RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER. END
BEGIN NOW —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Here, says he, take them END
BEGIN NOW to hell out of my sight, Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have? END
BEGIN NOW So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he END
BEGIN NOW couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well END
BEGIN NOW he'd just take a cigar. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake. END
BEGIN NOW —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a END
BEGIN NOW black border round it. END
BEGIN NOW —They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang END
BEGIN NOW their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. END
BEGIN NOW And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his END
BEGIN NOW heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they END
BEGIN NOW chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. END
BEGIN NOW In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. END
BEGIN NOW Their END
BEGIN NOW deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever END
BEGIN NOW wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so END
BEGIN NOW saith the Lord. END
BEGIN NOW So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom END
BEGIN NOW comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the END
BEGIN NOW business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies END
BEGIN NOW does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't END
BEGIN NOW know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on. END
BEGIN NOW —There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —That so? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —God's truth, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW I heard that from the head warder that was in END
BEGIN NOW Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. END
BEGIN NOW He told me when END
BEGIN NOW they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like END
BEGIN NOW a poker. END
BEGIN NOW —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said. END
BEGIN NOW —That can be explained by science, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW It's only a natural END
BEGIN NOW phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the... END
BEGIN NOW And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and END
BEGIN NOW this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. END
BEGIN NOW The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered END
BEGIN NOW medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the END
BEGIN NOW cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, END
BEGIN NOW according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be END
BEGIN NOW calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent END
BEGIN NOW ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, END
BEGIN NOW thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly END
BEGIN NOW dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood END
BEGIN NOW to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ END
BEGIN NOW resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a END
BEGIN NOW morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis END
BEGIN NOW per diminutionem capitis. END
BEGIN NOW So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and END
BEGIN NOW he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and END
BEGIN NOW the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with END
BEGIN NOW him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for END
BEGIN NOW the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that END
BEGIN NOW and the other. END
BEGIN NOW Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new END
BEGIN NOW dog so he ought. END
BEGIN NOW Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round END
BEGIN NOW the place and scratching his scabs. END
BEGIN NOW And round he goes to Bob Doran that END
BEGIN NOW was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. END
BEGIN NOW So of END
BEGIN NOW course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: END
BEGIN NOW —Give us the paw! END
BEGIN NOW Give the paw, doggy! END
BEGIN NOW Good old doggy! END
BEGIN NOW Give the paw END
BEGIN NOW here! END
BEGIN NOW Give us the paw! END
BEGIN NOW Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from END
BEGIN NOW tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking END
BEGIN NOW all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and END
BEGIN NOW intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts scraping a few END
BEGIN NOW bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to END
BEGIN NOW bring. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging END
BEGIN NOW out of him a yard long for more. END
BEGIN NOW Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody END
BEGIN NOW mongrel. END
BEGIN NOW And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the END
BEGIN NOW brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet END
BEGIN NOW and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and END
BEGIN NOW she's far from the land. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown END
BEGIN NOW cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. END
BEGIN NOW Phenomenon! END
BEGIN NOW The fat heap he END
BEGIN NOW married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. END
BEGIN NOW Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there END
BEGIN NOW was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom END
BEGIN NOW trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing END
BEGIN NOW bÃ©zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating END
BEGIN NOW meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and END
BEGIN NOW taking the lout out for a walk. END
BEGIN NOW And one time he led him the rounds of END
BEGIN NOW Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him END
BEGIN NOW home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the END

BEGIN NOW (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the END

BEGIN NOW distinguishable. END
BEGIN NOW It was exactly seventeen o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW The signal for prayer END

BEGIN NOW bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the END

BEGIN NOW The learned prelate who END

BEGIN NOW the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. END
BEGIN NOW Hand by the block END
BEGIN NOW stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in END
BEGIN NOW a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his END
BEGIN NOW eyes glowered furiously. END
BEGIN NOW As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the END
BEGIN NOW edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or END
BEGIN NOW decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided END
BEGIN NOW by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. END
BEGIN NOW On a handsome mahogany END
BEGIN NOW table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various END
BEGIN NOW finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the END

BEGIN NOW and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal END
BEGIN NOW should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and END

BEGIN NOW The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing END

BEGIN NOW and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be END
BEGIN NOW launched into eternity for her sake. END
BEGIN NOW The hero folded her willowy form in END
BEGIN NOW a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. END
BEGIN NOW Encouraged by this use END
BEGIN NOW of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable END
BEGIN NOW areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her END
BEGIN NOW ardour to reach. END
BEGIN NOW She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of END
BEGIN NOW their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never END
BEGIN NOW forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if END
BEGIN NOW he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. END
BEGIN NOW She brought back END
BEGIN NOW to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the END
BEGIN NOW banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of END
BEGIN NOW the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed END
BEGIN NOW heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in END
BEGIN NOW the general merriment. END
BEGIN NOW That monster audience simply rocked with delight. END
BEGIN NOW But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the END
BEGIN NOW last time. END
BEGIN NOW A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and END
BEGIN NOW the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into END
BEGIN NOW heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary END
BEGIN NOW himself. END
BEGIN NOW Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the END
BEGIN NOW royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs END
BEGIN NOW and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record END
BEGIN NOW assemblage. END
BEGIN NOW A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young END
BEGIN NOW Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped END
BEGIN NOW forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical END
BEGIN NOW tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to END
BEGIN NOW name the day, and was accepted on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Every lady in the audience END
BEGIN NOW was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a END
BEGIN NOW skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a END
BEGIN NOW fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the END
BEGIN NOW bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's END
BEGIN NOW history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancÃ©e an expensive END
BEGIN NOW engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock END
BEGIN NOW the excitement knew no bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, END
BEGIN NOW lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided END
BEGIN NOW on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys END
BEGIN NOW from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his END
BEGIN NOW natural emotion. END
BEGIN NOW With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear END
BEGIN NOW and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in END
BEGIN NOW his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: END
BEGIN NOW —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. END
BEGIN NOW Blimey it END
BEGIN NOW makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause END
BEGIN NOW I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way. END
BEGIN NOW So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the END
BEGIN NOW corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak END
BEGIN NOW their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a END
BEGIN NOW quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he END
BEGIN NOW cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the END
BEGIN NOW antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Antitreating is END
BEGIN NOW about the size of it. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down END
BEGIN NOW his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth END
BEGIN NOW of his pint. END
BEGIN NOW And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their END
BEGIN NOW musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of END
BEGIN NOW hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly END
BEGIN NOW blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen END
BEGIN NOW bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and END
BEGIN NOW oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh END
BEGIN NOW entertainment, don't be talking. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland sober is Ireland free. END
BEGIN NOW And then END
BEGIN NOW an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers END
BEGIN NOW shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. END
BEGIN NOW And one or two sky END
BEGIN NOW pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the END
BEGIN NOW females, hitting below the belt. END
BEGIN NOW So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty END
BEGIN NOW starts mousing around by Joe and me. END
BEGIN NOW I'd train him by kindness, so I END
BEGIN NOW would, if he was my dog. END
BEGIN NOW Give him a rousing fine kick now and again END
BEGIN NOW where it wouldn't blind him. END
BEGIN NOW —Afraid he'll bite you? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen, jeering. END
BEGIN NOW —No, says I. END
BEGIN NOW But he might take my leg for a lamppost. END
BEGIN NOW So he calls the old dog over. END
BEGIN NOW —What's on you, Garry? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the END
BEGIN NOW old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. END
BEGIN NOW Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. END
BEGIN NOW Someone that END
BEGIN NOW has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the END
BEGIN NOW papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. END
BEGIN NOW Growling and END
BEGIN NOW grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the END
BEGIN NOW hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws. END
BEGIN NOW All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the END
BEGIN NOW lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not END
BEGIN NOW missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the END
BEGIN NOW famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of END
BEGIN NOW Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and END
BEGIN NOW acquaintances Owen Garry. END
BEGIN NOW The exhibition, which is the result of years END
BEGIN NOW of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, END
BEGIN NOW comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. END
BEGIN NOW Our END
BEGIN NOW greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) END
BEGIN NOW has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the END
BEGIN NOW verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics END
BEGIN NOW are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. END
BEGIN NOW We are not speaking so END
BEGIN NOW much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals END
BEGIN NOW his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has END
BEGIN NOW familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. END
BEGIN NOW O. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW points out in an interesting communication published by an evening END
BEGIN NOW contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in END
BEGIN NOW the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine END
BEGIN NOW to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the END
BEGIN NOW public eye. END
BEGIN NOW We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English END
BEGIN NOW by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to END
BEGIN NOW disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical END
BEGIN NOW allusion rather more than an indication. END
BEGIN NOW The metrical system of the END
BEGIN NOW canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and END
BEGIN NOW isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated END
BEGIN NOW but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well END
BEGIN NOW caught. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased END
BEGIN NOW if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone END
BEGIN NOW suggestive of suppressed rancour. END
BEGIN NOW The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On END
BEGIN NOW you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts END
BEGIN NOW red roaring After Lowry's lights. END
BEGIN NOW So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could END
BEGIN NOW hear him lapping it up a mile off. END
BEGIN NOW And Joe asked him would he have END
BEGIN NOW another. END
BEGIN NOW —I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. END
BEGIN NOW Arsing around from one END
BEGIN NOW pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog END
BEGIN NOW and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. END
BEGIN NOW Entertainment for END
BEGIN NOW man and beast. END
BEGIN NOW And says Joe: END
BEGIN NOW —Could you make a hole in another pint? END
BEGIN NOW —Could a swim duck? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Same again, Terry, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Are you sure you won't have anything in END
BEGIN NOW the way of liquid refreshment? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, no, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW Martin asked me to go to the house. END
BEGIN NOW You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't END
BEGIN NOW serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and END
BEGIN NOW nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy. END
BEGIN NOW —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is END
BEGIN NOW landed. END
BEGIN NOW So the wife comes out top dog, what? END
BEGIN NOW —Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers. END
BEGIN NOW —Whose admirers? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act END
BEGIN NOW like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit END
BEGIN NOW of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that END
BEGIN NOW Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow END
BEGIN NOW contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled END
BEGIN NOW with his mortgagor under the act. END
BEGIN NOW He was bloody safe he wasn't run in END
BEGIN NOW himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a END
BEGIN NOW friend in court. END
BEGIN NOW Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal END
BEGIN NOW Hungarian privileged lottery. END
BEGIN NOW True as you're there. END
BEGIN NOW O, commend me to an END
BEGIN NOW israelite! END
BEGIN NOW Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery. END
BEGIN NOW So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he END
BEGIN NOW was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to END
BEGIN NOW tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was END
BEGIN NOW never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. END
BEGIN NOW Choking with bloody foolery. END
BEGIN NOW And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic END
BEGIN NOW to tell her that. END
BEGIN NOW Shake hands, brother. END
BEGIN NOW You're a rogue and I'm another. END
BEGIN NOW —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however END
BEGIN NOW slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, END
BEGIN NOW as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of END
BEGIN NOW you this favour. END
BEGIN NOW But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve END
BEGIN NOW let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. END
BEGIN NOW —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which END
BEGIN NOW actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me END
BEGIN NOW consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of END
BEGIN NOW the cup. END
BEGIN NOW —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. END
BEGIN NOW The goodness of your heart, END
BEGIN NOW I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the END
BEGIN NOW expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose END
BEGIN NOW poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of END
BEGIN NOW speech. END
BEGIN NOW And off with him and out trying to walk straight. END
BEGIN NOW Boosed at five END
BEGIN NOW o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the END
BEGIN NOW bobby, 14A. END
BEGIN NOW Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after END
BEGIN NOW closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking END
BEGIN NOW porter out of teacups. END
BEGIN NOW And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, END
BEGIN NOW Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving END
BEGIN NOW mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote END
BEGIN NOW the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody END
BEGIN NOW fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls END
BEGIN NOW screeching laughing at one another. END
BEGIN NOW How is your testament? END
BEGIN NOW Have you got END
BEGIN NOW an old testament? END
BEGIN NOW Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. END
BEGIN NOW Then END
BEGIN NOW see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging END
BEGIN NOW her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no END
BEGIN NOW less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. END
BEGIN NOW Jack Mooney's END
BEGIN NOW sister. END
BEGIN NOW And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street END
BEGIN NOW couples. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, Jack made him toe the line. END
BEGIN NOW Told him if he didn't patch up END
BEGIN NOW the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him. END
BEGIN NOW So Terry brought the three pints. END
BEGIN NOW —Here, says Joe, doing the honours. END
BEGIN NOW Here, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —Slan leat, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Fortune, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Good health, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. END
BEGIN NOW Want a small END
BEGIN NOW fortune to keep him in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Friend of yours, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Nannan? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The mimber? END
BEGIN NOW —I won't mention any names, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —I thought so, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW I saw him up at that meeting now with William END
BEGIN NOW Field, M. END
BEGIN NOW P., the cattle traders. END
BEGIN NOW —Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of END
BEGIN NOW all countries and the idol of his own. END
BEGIN NOW So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and END
BEGIN NOW the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen END
BEGIN NOW sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his END
BEGIN NOW sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the END
BEGIN NOW guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Because he was up one time in a END
BEGIN NOW knacker's yard. END
BEGIN NOW Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head END
BEGIN NOW and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot END
BEGIN NOW for giving lip to a grazier. END
BEGIN NOW Mister Knowall. END
BEGIN NOW Teach your grandmother how END
BEGIN NOW to milk ducks. END
BEGIN NOW Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to END
BEGIN NOW be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out END
BEGIN NOW with her eight inches of fat all over her. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't loosen her farting END
BEGIN NOW strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW What's your programme today? END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Humane methods. END
BEGIN NOW Because the poor END
BEGIN NOW animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't END
BEGIN NOW cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, END
BEGIN NOW he'd have a soft hand under a hen. END
BEGIN NOW Ga Ga Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW Black Liz is our hen. END
BEGIN NOW She lays eggs for END
BEGIN NOW us. END
BEGIN NOW When she lays her egg she is so glad. END
BEGIN NOW Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW Then END
BEGIN NOW comes good uncle Leo. END
BEGIN NOW He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her END
BEGIN NOW fresh egg. END
BEGIN NOW Ga ga ga ga Gara. END
BEGIN NOW Klook Klook Klook. END
BEGIN NOW —Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London END
BEGIN NOW to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to see him, END
BEGIN NOW as it happens. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight. END
BEGIN NOW —That's too bad, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted particularly. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps only Mr END
BEGIN NOW Field is going. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't phone. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You're sure? END
BEGIN NOW —Nannan's going too, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The league told him to ask a question END
BEGIN NOW tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the END
BEGIN NOW park. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of that, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW The Sluagh na h-Eireann. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. END
BEGIN NOW Nat.): Arising out of the question of my END
BEGIN NOW honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right END
BEGIN NOW honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these END
BEGIN NOW animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming END
BEGIN NOW as to their pathological condition? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. END
BEGIN NOW Con.): Honourable members are already in END
BEGIN NOW possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole END
BEGIN NOW house. END
BEGIN NOW I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. END
BEGIN NOW The answer to the END
BEGIN NOW honourable member's question is in the affirmative. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. END
BEGIN NOW Nat.): Have similar orders been issued END
BEGIN NOW for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the END
BEGIN NOW Phoenix park? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous END
BEGIN NOW Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury END
BEGIN NOW bench? END
BEGIN NOW (O! END
BEGIN NOW O!) END
BEGIN NOW Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. END
BEGIN NOW Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot. END
BEGIN NOW (Ironical opposition cheers.) END
BEGIN NOW The speaker: Order! END
BEGIN NOW Order! END
BEGIN NOW (The house rises. END
BEGIN NOW Cheers.) END
BEGIN NOW —There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. END
BEGIN NOW There END
BEGIN NOW he is sitting there. END
BEGIN NOW The man that got away James Stephens. END
BEGIN NOW The champion END
BEGIN NOW of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. END
BEGIN NOW What was your best END
BEGIN NOW throw, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW —Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. END
BEGIN NOW There was a time END
BEGIN NOW I was as good as the next fellow anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW —Put it there, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW You were and a bloody sight better. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that really a fact? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW That's well known. END
BEGIN NOW Did you not know that? END
BEGIN NOW So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of END
BEGIN NOW lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil END
BEGIN NOW and building up a nation once again and all to that. END
BEGIN NOW And of course Bloom END
BEGIN NOW had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent END
BEGIN NOW exercise was bad. END
BEGIN NOW I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw END
BEGIN NOW from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Do you END
BEGIN NOW see that straw? END
BEGIN NOW That's a straw. END
BEGIN NOW Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it END
BEGIN NOW for an hour so he would and talk steady. END
BEGIN NOW A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian END
BEGIN NOW O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na END
BEGIN NOW h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of END
BEGIN NOW physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and END
BEGIN NOW ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. END
BEGIN NOW The venerable END
BEGIN NOW president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of END
BEGIN NOW large dimensions. END
BEGIN NOW After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a END
BEGIN NOW magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most END
BEGIN NOW interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of END
BEGIN NOW excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the END
BEGIN NOW ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of END
BEGIN NOW the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by END
BEGIN NOW Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly END
BEGIN NOW strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. END
BEGIN NOW L. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, who END
BEGIN NOW met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the END
BEGIN NOW negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in END
BEGIN NOW response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a END
BEGIN NOW bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal END
BEGIN NOW Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need END
BEGIN NOW recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the END
BEGIN NOW veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to END
BEGIN NOW have fairly excelled himself. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in END
BEGIN NOW superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest END
BEGIN NOW advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly END
BEGIN NOW enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously END
BEGIN NOW applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many END

BEGIN NOW —Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh- END
BEGIN NOW Bennett match? END
BEGIN NOW —No, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW Blazes? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And says Bloom: END
BEGIN NOW —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the END
BEGIN NOW eye. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, Blazes, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up END
BEGIN NOW the odds and he swatting all the time. END
BEGIN NOW —We know him, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW The traitor's son. END
BEGIN NOW We know what put END
BEGIN NOW English gold in his pocket. END
BEGIN NOW —-True for you, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the END
BEGIN NOW blood, asking Alf: END
BEGIN NOW —Now, don't you think, Bergan? END
BEGIN NOW —Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Heenan and Sayers was only a END
BEGIN NOW bloody fool to it. END
BEGIN NOW Handed him the father and mother of a beating. END
BEGIN NOW See END
BEGIN NOW the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. END
BEGIN NOW God, END
BEGIN NOW he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made END
BEGIN NOW him puke what he never ate. END
BEGIN NOW It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled END
BEGIN NOW to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW Handicapped as he END
BEGIN NOW was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative END
BEGIN NOW skill in ringcraft. END
BEGIN NOW The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both END
BEGIN NOW champions. END
BEGIN NOW The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret END
BEGIN NOW in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of END
BEGIN NOW rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the END
BEGIN NOW pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. END
BEGIN NOW The soldier got to END
BEGIN NOW business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish END
BEGIN NOW gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of END
BEGIN NOW Bennett's jaw. END
BEGIN NOW The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a END
BEGIN NOW left hook, the body punch being a fine one. END
BEGIN NOW The men came to handigrips. END
BEGIN NOW Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with END
BEGIN NOW the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. END
BEGIN NOW The Englishman, whose END
BEGIN NOW right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally END
BEGIN NOW drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of END
BEGIN NOW pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. END
BEGIN NOW It was END
BEGIN NOW a fight to a finish and the best man for it. END
BEGIN NOW The two fought like tigers END
BEGIN NOW and excitement ran fever high. END
BEGIN NOW The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy END
BEGIN NOW for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. END
BEGIN NOW After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of END
BEGIN NOW the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb END
BEGIN NOW suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to END
BEGIN NOW Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. END
BEGIN NOW It was a knockout clean END
BEGIN NOW and clever. END
BEGIN NOW Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being END
BEGIN NOW counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the END
BEGIN NOW towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of END
BEGIN NOW the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with END
BEGIN NOW delight. END
BEGIN NOW —He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW I hear he's END
BEGIN NOW running a concert tour now up in the north. END
BEGIN NOW —He is, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, yes. END
BEGIN NOW That's quite true. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a kind of summer END
BEGIN NOW tour, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Just a holiday. END
BEGIN NOW —Mrs B. END
BEGIN NOW is the bright particular star, isn't she? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —My wife? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW She's singing, yes. END
BEGIN NOW I think it will be a success END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW He's an excellent man to organise. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent. END
BEGIN NOW Hoho begob says I to myself says I. END
BEGIN NOW That explains the milk in the END
BEGIN NOW cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. END
BEGIN NOW Blazes doing the END
BEGIN NOW tootle on the flute. END
BEGIN NOW Concert tour. END
BEGIN NOW Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island END
BEGIN NOW bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight END
BEGIN NOW the Boers. END
BEGIN NOW Old Whatwhat. END
BEGIN NOW I called about the poor and water rate, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW You what? END
BEGIN NOW The water rate, Mr Boylan. END
BEGIN NOW You whatwhat? END
BEGIN NOW That's the END
BEGIN NOW bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh. END
BEGIN NOW Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. END
BEGIN NOW There END
BEGIN NOW grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. END
BEGIN NOW The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms. END
BEGIN NOW And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero END
BEGIN NOW of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned END
BEGIN NOW in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of END
BEGIN NOW Lambert. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Ned. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW —Hello, Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —God save you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —Save you kindly, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW What'll it be, Ned? END
BEGIN NOW —Half one, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW So J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW ordered the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW —Were you round at the court? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW He'll square that, Ned, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Hope so, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Now what were those two at? END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW getting him off the grand jury list END
BEGIN NOW and the other give him a leg over the stile. END
BEGIN NOW With his name in Stubbs's. END
BEGIN NOW Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their END
BEGIN NOW eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. END
BEGIN NOW Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would END
BEGIN NOW know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing END
BEGIN NOW his boots out of the pop. END
BEGIN NOW What's your name, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Dunne, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, and END
BEGIN NOW done says I. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, END
BEGIN NOW I'm thinking. END
BEGIN NOW —Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW U. END
BEGIN NOW p: up. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW Looking for a private detective. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined END
BEGIN NOW first. END
BEGIN NOW —Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW God, I'd give anything to hear END
BEGIN NOW him before a judge and jury. END
BEGIN NOW —Was it you did it, Alf? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW The truth, the whole truth and END
BEGIN NOW nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson. END
BEGIN NOW —Me? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character. END
BEGIN NOW —Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence END
BEGIN NOW against you. END
BEGIN NOW —Of course an action would lie, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW It implies that he is not END
BEGIN NOW compos mentis. END
BEGIN NOW U. END
BEGIN NOW p: up. END
BEGIN NOW —Compos your eye! END
BEGIN NOW says Alf, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that he's balmy? END
BEGIN NOW Look END
BEGIN NOW at his head. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on END
BEGIN NOW with a shoehorn. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an END
BEGIN NOW indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law. END
BEGIN NOW —Ha ha, Alf, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife. END
BEGIN NOW —Pity about her, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Or any other woman marries a half and END
BEGIN NOW half. END
BEGIN NOW —How half and half? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Do you mean he... END
BEGIN NOW —Half and half I mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow that's neither fish END
BEGIN NOW nor flesh. END
BEGIN NOW —Nor good red herring, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —That what's I mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW A pishogue, if you know what that END
BEGIN NOW is. END
BEGIN NOW Begob I saw there was trouble coming. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom explaining he meant on END
BEGIN NOW account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old END
BEGIN NOW stuttering fool. END
BEGIN NOW Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody END
BEGIN NOW povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, END
BEGIN NOW bringing down the rain. END
BEGIN NOW And she with her nose cockahoop after she END
BEGIN NOW married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the END
BEGIN NOW pope. END
BEGIN NOW Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, END
BEGIN NOW the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the END
BEGIN NOW Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. END
BEGIN NOW And who was he, END
BEGIN NOW tell us? END
BEGIN NOW A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a END
BEGIN NOW week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to END
BEGIN NOW the world. END
BEGIN NOW —And moreover, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J., a postcard is publication. END
BEGIN NOW It was held to be END
BEGIN NOW sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. END
BEGIN NOW Hole. END
BEGIN NOW In my END
BEGIN NOW opinion an action might lie. END
BEGIN NOW Six and eightpence, please. END
BEGIN NOW Who wants your opinion? END
BEGIN NOW Let us drink our END
BEGIN NOW pints in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, good health, Jack, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW —Good health, Ned, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW —-There he is again, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Where? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter END
BEGIN NOW and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in END
BEGIN NOW as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a END
BEGIN NOW secondhand coffin. END
BEGIN NOW —How did that Canada swindle case go off? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Remanded, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James END
BEGIN NOW Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers END
BEGIN NOW saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Do you see END
BEGIN NOW any green in the white of my eye? END
BEGIN NOW Course it was a bloody barney. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and END
BEGIN NOW his own kidney too. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew END
BEGIN NOW Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, END
BEGIN NOW swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid. END
BEGIN NOW —Who tried the case? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Recorder, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW —Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes. END
BEGIN NOW —Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him a tale of woe about arrears END
BEGIN NOW of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve END
BEGIN NOW in tears on the bench. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock END
BEGIN NOW the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for END
BEGIN NOW the corporation there near Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: END
BEGIN NOW —A most scandalous thing! END
BEGIN NOW This poor hardworking man! END
BEGIN NOW How many children? END
BEGIN NOW Ten, did you say? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, your worship. END
BEGIN NOW And my wife has the typhoid. END
BEGIN NOW —And the wife with typhoid fever! END
BEGIN NOW Scandalous! END
BEGIN NOW Leave the court END
BEGIN NOW immediately, sir. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. END
BEGIN NOW How dare you, END
BEGIN NOW sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! END
BEGIN NOW A poor hardworking END
BEGIN NOW industrious man! END
BEGIN NOW I dismiss the case. END
BEGIN NOW And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and END
BEGIN NOW in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, END
BEGIN NOW the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first END
BEGIN NOW quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the END
BEGIN NOW halls of law. END
BEGIN NOW There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave END
BEGIN NOW his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the END
BEGIN NOW probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first END
BEGIN NOW chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and END
BEGIN NOW final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the END
BEGIN NOW late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an END
BEGIN NOW infant, of unsound mind, and another. END
BEGIN NOW And to the solemn court of Green END
BEGIN NOW street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. END
BEGIN NOW And he sat him there about END
BEGIN NOW the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the END
BEGIN NOW commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the END
BEGIN NOW county of the city of Dublin. END
BEGIN NOW And there sat with him the high sinhedrim END
BEGIN NOW of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of END
BEGIN NOW Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the END
BEGIN NOW tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and END
BEGIN NOW of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of END
BEGIN NOW Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the END
BEGIN NOW tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. END
BEGIN NOW And he END
BEGIN NOW conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly END
BEGIN NOW try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their END
BEGIN NOW sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict END
BEGIN NOW give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the END
BEGIN NOW name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His END
BEGIN NOW rightwiseness. END
BEGIN NOW And straightway the minions of the law led forth from END
BEGIN NOW their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended END
BEGIN NOW in consequence of information received. END
BEGIN NOW And they shackled him hand and END
BEGIN NOW foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge END
BEGIN NOW against him for he was a malefactor. END
BEGIN NOW —Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland END
BEGIN NOW filling the country with bugs. END
BEGIN NOW So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, END
BEGIN NOW telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first END
BEGIN NOW but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW And so Joe swore high END
BEGIN NOW and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all. END
BEGIN NOW —Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have END
BEGIN NOW repetition. END
BEGIN NOW That's the whole secret. END
BEGIN NOW —Rely on me, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW want no more strangers in our house. END
BEGIN NOW —O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW It's just that END
BEGIN NOW Keyes, you see. END
BEGIN NOW —Consider that done, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Very kind of you, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW —The strangers, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Our own fault. END
BEGIN NOW We let them come in. END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW brought them in. END
BEGIN NOW The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon END
BEGIN NOW robbers here. END
BEGIN NOW —Decree nisi, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a END
BEGIN NOW spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling END
BEGIN NOW after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and END
BEGIN NOW when. END
BEGIN NOW —A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all END
BEGIN NOW our misfortunes. END
BEGIN NOW —And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette END
BEGIN NOW with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. END
BEGIN NOW —Give us a squint at her, says I. END
BEGIN NOW And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off END
BEGIN NOW of Corny Kelleher. END
BEGIN NOW Secrets for enlarging your private parts. END
BEGIN NOW Misconduct END
BEGIN NOW of society belle. END
BEGIN NOW Norman W. END
BEGIN NOW Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds END
BEGIN NOW pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. END
BEGIN NOW Belle in her END
BEGIN NOW bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles END
BEGIN NOW and Norman W. END
BEGIN NOW Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be END
BEGIN NOW late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor. END
BEGIN NOW —O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! END
BEGIN NOW —There's hair, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off END
BEGIN NOW of that one, what? END
BEGIN NOW So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on END
BEGIN NOW him as long as a late breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? END
BEGIN NOW What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide END
BEGIN NOW about the Irish language? END
BEGIN NOW O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the END
BEGIN NOW puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of END
BEGIN NOW that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient END
BEGIN NOW city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after END
BEGIN NOW due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn END
BEGIN NOW counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into END
BEGIN NOW honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael. END
BEGIN NOW —It's on the march, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW To hell with the bloody brutal END
BEGIN NOW Sassenachs and their patois. END
BEGIN NOW So J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till END
BEGIN NOW you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your END
BEGIN NOW blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach END
BEGIN NOW a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and END
BEGIN NOW their colonies and their civilisation. END
BEGIN NOW —Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW To hell with them! END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged END
BEGIN NOW sons of whores' gets! END
BEGIN NOW No music and no art and no literature worthy of END
BEGIN NOW the name. END
BEGIN NOW Any civilisation they have they stole from us. END
BEGIN NOW Tonguetied sons END
BEGIN NOW of bastards' ghosts. END
BEGIN NOW —The European family, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J.... END
BEGIN NOW —They're not European, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW I was in Europe with Kevin Egan END
BEGIN NOW of Paris. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in END
BEGIN NOW Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance. END
BEGIN NOW And says John Wyse: END
BEGIN NOW —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen. END
BEGIN NOW And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: END
BEGIN NOW —Conspuez les Anglais! END
BEGIN NOW Perfide Albion! END
BEGIN NOW He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the END
BEGIN NOW medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh END
BEGIN NOW Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty END
BEGIN NOW valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster END
BEGIN NOW silent as the deathless gods. END
BEGIN NOW —What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW You look like a fellow that had END
BEGIN NOW lost a bob and found a tanner. END
BEGIN NOW —Gold cup, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Who won, Mr Lenehan? END
BEGIN NOW says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW —Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. END
BEGIN NOW A rank outsider. END
BEGIN NOW And the rest END
BEGIN NOW nowhere. END
BEGIN NOW —And Bass's mare? END
BEGIN NOW says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW —Still running, says he. END
BEGIN NOW We're all in a cart. END
BEGIN NOW Boylan plunged two quid on END
BEGIN NOW my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend. END
BEGIN NOW —I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave END
BEGIN NOW me. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Howard de Walden's. END
BEGIN NOW —Twenty to one, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Such is life in an outhouse. END
BEGIN NOW Throwaway, END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. END
BEGIN NOW Frailty, thy name END
BEGIN NOW is Sceptre. END
BEGIN NOW So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was END
BEGIN NOW anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his END
BEGIN NOW luck with his mangy snout up. END
BEGIN NOW Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard. END
BEGIN NOW —Not there, my child, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Keep your pecker up, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW She'd have won the money only for the END

BEGIN NOW —Raimeis, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW There's no-one as blind as the fellow that END

BEGIN NOW Moya. END
BEGIN NOW All wind and piss like END
BEGIN NOW a tanyard cat. END

BEGIN NOW As much as his bloody END

BEGIN NOW Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the END
BEGIN NOW holding of an evicted tenant. END
BEGIN NOW —Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW What will you have? END
BEGIN NOW —An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW —Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. END
BEGIN NOW Terry! END
BEGIN NOW Are you asleep? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. END
BEGIN NOW Right, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of END
BEGIN NOW attending to the general public. END
BEGIN NOW Picture of a butting match, trying to END
BEGIN NOW crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head END
BEGIN NOW down like a bull at a gate. END
BEGIN NOW And another one: Black Beast Burned in END
BEGIN NOW Omaha, Ga. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a END
BEGIN NOW Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and END
BEGIN NOW crucify him to make sure of their job. END
BEGIN NOW —But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay? END
BEGIN NOW —I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Hell upon earth it is. END
BEGIN NOW Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the END
BEGIN NOW training ships at Portsmouth. END
BEGIN NOW A fellow writes that calls himself END
BEGIN NOW Disgusted One. END
BEGIN NOW So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of END
BEGIN NOW tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the END
BEGIN NOW parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad END
BEGIN NOW brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of END
BEGIN NOW a gun. END
BEGIN NOW —A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John END
BEGIN NOW Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on END
BEGIN NOW the breech. END
BEGIN NOW And says John Wyse: END
BEGIN NOW —'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance. END
BEGIN NOW Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane END
BEGIN NOW and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad END
BEGIN NOW till he yells meila murder. END
BEGIN NOW —That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the END
BEGIN NOW earth. END
BEGIN NOW The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber END
BEGIN NOW on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen END
BEGIN NOW gamehogs and cottonball barons. END
BEGIN NOW That's the great empire they boast about END
BEGIN NOW of drudges and whipped serfs. END
BEGIN NOW —On which the sun never rises, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW unfortunate yahoos believe it. END
BEGIN NOW They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, END
BEGIN NOW and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, END
BEGIN NOW born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, END
BEGIN NOW flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose END
BEGIN NOW again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till END
BEGIN NOW further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid. END
BEGIN NOW —But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW I mean wouldn't END
BEGIN NOW it be the same here if you put force against force? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't I tell you? END
BEGIN NOW As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his END
BEGIN NOW last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. END
BEGIN NOW —We'll put force against force, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW We have our greater END
BEGIN NOW Ireland beyond the sea. END
BEGIN NOW They were driven out of house and home in the END
BEGIN NOW black 47. END
BEGIN NOW Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid END
BEGIN NOW low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the END
BEGIN NOW whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as END
BEGIN NOW redskins in America. END
BEGIN NOW Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. END
BEGIN NOW But the END
BEGIN NOW Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of END
BEGIN NOW crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, END
BEGIN NOW they drove out the peasants in hordes. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty thousand of them died in END
BEGIN NOW the coffinships. END
BEGIN NOW But those that came to the land of the free remember END
BEGIN NOW the land of bondage. END
BEGIN NOW And they will come again and with a vengeance, no END
BEGIN NOW cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan. END
BEGIN NOW —Perfectly true, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW But my point was... END
BEGIN NOW —We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Since the END
BEGIN NOW poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at END
BEGIN NOW Killala. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us END
BEGIN NOW against the Williamites and they betrayed us. END
BEGIN NOW Remember Limerick and the END
BEGIN NOW broken treatystone. END
BEGIN NOW We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild END
BEGIN NOW geese. END
BEGIN NOW Fontenoy, eh? END
BEGIN NOW And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in END
BEGIN NOW Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria END
BEGIN NOW Teresa. END
BEGIN NOW But what did we ever get for it? END
BEGIN NOW —The French! END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Set of dancing masters! END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what END
BEGIN NOW it is? END
BEGIN NOW They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Aren't they END
BEGIN NOW trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with END
BEGIN NOW perfidious Albion? END
BEGIN NOW Firebrands of Europe and they always were. END
BEGIN NOW —Conspuez les FranÃ§ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer. END
BEGIN NOW —And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had END
BEGIN NOW enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the END
BEGIN NOW elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead? END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one END
BEGIN NOW with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of END
BEGIN NOW God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting END
BEGIN NOW her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the END
BEGIN NOW whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and END
BEGIN NOW come where the boose is cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW We have Edward the peacemaker now. END
BEGIN NOW —Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW There's a bloody sight more pox END
BEGIN NOW than pax about that boyo. END
BEGIN NOW Edward Guelph-Wettin! END
BEGIN NOW —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and END
BEGIN NOW bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic END
BEGIN NOW Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his END
BEGIN NOW jockeys rode. END
BEGIN NOW The earl of Dublin, no less. END
BEGIN NOW —They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little END
BEGIN NOW Alf. END
BEGIN NOW And says J. END
BEGIN NOW J.: END
BEGIN NOW —Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision. END
BEGIN NOW —Will you try another, citizen? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, sir, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I will. END
BEGIN NOW —You? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Beholden to you, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW May your shadow never grow less. END
BEGIN NOW —Repeat that dose, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with END
BEGIN NOW his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. END
BEGIN NOW —Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. END
BEGIN NOW Perpetuating national hatred among nations. END
BEGIN NOW —But do you know what a nation means? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW —What is it? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW —A nation? END
BEGIN NOW says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW A nation is the same people living in the same END
BEGIN NOW place. END
BEGIN NOW —By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm END
BEGIN NOW living in the same place for the past five years. END
BEGIN NOW So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck END
BEGIN NOW out of it: END
BEGIN NOW —Or also living in different places. END
BEGIN NOW —That covers my case, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —What is your nation if I may ask? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —Ireland, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW I was born here. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, END
BEGIN NOW gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. END
BEGIN NOW —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to END
BEGIN NOW swab himself dry. END
BEGIN NOW —Here you are, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Take that in your right hand and END
BEGIN NOW repeat after me the following words. END
BEGIN NOW The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth END
BEGIN NOW attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors END
BEGIN NOW of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth END
BEGIN NOW prolonged admiration. END
BEGIN NOW No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the END
BEGIN NOW cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each END
BEGIN NOW of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters END
BEGIN NOW his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far END
BEGIN NOW nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), END
BEGIN NOW a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. END
BEGIN NOW The scenes depicted END
BEGIN NOW on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs END
BEGIN NOW and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as END
BEGIN NOW wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo END
BEGIN NOW illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in END
BEGIN NOW the time of the Barmecides. END
BEGIN NOW Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, END
BEGIN NOW the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, END
BEGIN NOW Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery END
BEGIN NOW of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's END
BEGIN NOW banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick END
BEGIN NOW Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the END
BEGIN NOW Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, END
BEGIN NOW Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, END
BEGIN NOW Jury's Hotel, S. END
BEGIN NOW Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college END
BEGIN NOW refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of END
BEGIN NOW Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street END
BEGIN NOW Warehouse, Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us END
BEGIN NOW today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have END
BEGIN NOW passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time. END
BEGIN NOW —Show us over the drink, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Which is which? END
BEGIN NOW —That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman. END
BEGIN NOW —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. END
BEGIN NOW Also now. END
BEGIN NOW This very moment. END
BEGIN NOW This very instant. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar. END
BEGIN NOW —Robbed, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Plundered. END
BEGIN NOW Insulted. END
BEGIN NOW Persecuted. END
BEGIN NOW Taking what belongs END
BEGIN NOW to us by right. END
BEGIN NOW At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold END
BEGIN NOW by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW —Right, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW Stand up to it then with force like men. END
BEGIN NOW That's an almanac picture for you. END
BEGIN NOW Mark for a softnosed bullet. END
BEGIN NOW Old END
BEGIN NOW lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he'd adorn a END
BEGIN NOW sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as END
BEGIN NOW limp as a wet rag. END
BEGIN NOW —But it's no use, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Force, hatred, history, all that. END
BEGIN NOW That's not END
BEGIN NOW life for men and women, insult and hatred. END
BEGIN NOW And everybody knows that it's END
BEGIN NOW the very opposite of that that is really life. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —Love, says Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW I mean the opposite of hatred. END
BEGIN NOW I must go now, says he END
BEGIN NOW to John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is END
BEGIN NOW there. END
BEGIN NOW If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Who's hindering you? END
BEGIN NOW And off he pops like greased lightning. END
BEGIN NOW —A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Universal love. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that what we're told. END
BEGIN NOW Love your neighbour. END
BEGIN NOW —That chap? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Beggar my neighbour is his motto. END
BEGIN NOW Love, END
BEGIN NOW moya! END
BEGIN NOW He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet. END
BEGIN NOW Love loves to love love. END
BEGIN NOW Nurse loves the new chemist. END
BEGIN NOW Constable 14A END
BEGIN NOW loves Mary Kelly. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. END
BEGIN NOW M. END
BEGIN NOW B. END
BEGIN NOW loves a fair gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. END
BEGIN NOW Jumbo, END
BEGIN NOW the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. END
BEGIN NOW Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear END
BEGIN NOW trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. END
BEGIN NOW The man in the END
BEGIN NOW brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. END
BEGIN NOW His Majesty the King loves Her END
BEGIN NOW Majesty the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Norman W. END
BEGIN NOW Tupper loves officer Taylor. END
BEGIN NOW You love a END
BEGIN NOW certain person. END
BEGIN NOW And this person loves that other person because END
BEGIN NOW everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. END
BEGIN NOW More power, citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —Hurrah, there, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. END
BEGIN NOW —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. END
BEGIN NOW What END
BEGIN NOW about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and END
BEGIN NOW children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted END
BEGIN NOW round the mouth of his cannon? END
BEGIN NOW The bible! END
BEGIN NOW Did you read that skit in the END
BEGIN NOW United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England? END
BEGIN NOW —What's that? END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts END
BEGIN NOW reading out: END
BEGIN NOW —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented END
BEGIN NOW yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, END
BEGIN NOW Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt END
BEGIN NOW thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his END
BEGIN NOW dominions. END
BEGIN NOW The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which END
BEGIN NOW the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated END
BEGIN NOW by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, END
BEGIN NOW tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial END
BEGIN NOW relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that END
BEGIN NOW he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the END
BEGIN NOW volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, END
BEGIN NOW graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw END
BEGIN NOW Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal END
BEGIN NOW Donor. END
BEGIN NOW The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the END
BEGIN NOW toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the END
BEGIN NOW dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the END
BEGIN NOW chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, END
BEGIN NOW subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course END
BEGIN NOW of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause END
BEGIN NOW from the girl hands. END
BEGIN NOW —Widow woman, says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't doubt her. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder did he put that END
BEGIN NOW bible to the same use as I would. END
BEGIN NOW —Same only more so, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW And thereafter in that fruitful land END
BEGIN NOW the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that by Griffith? END
BEGIN NOW says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW —No, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW It's not signed Shanganagh. END
BEGIN NOW It's only initialled: END
BEGIN NOW P. END
BEGIN NOW —And a very good initial too, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —That's how it's worked, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Trade follows the flag. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo END
BEGIN NOW Free State they must be bad. END
BEGIN NOW Did you read that report by a man what's END
BEGIN NOW this his name is? END
BEGIN NOW —Casement, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW He's an Irishman. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, that's the man, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW Raping the women and girls and flogging END
BEGIN NOW the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW —I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW —Who? END
BEGIN NOW says I. END
BEGIN NOW —Bloom, says he. END
BEGIN NOW The courthouse is a blind. END
BEGIN NOW He had a few bob on END
BEGIN NOW Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels. END
BEGIN NOW —Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen, that never backed a END
BEGIN NOW horse in anger in his life? END
BEGIN NOW —That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW I met Bantam Lyons going to back END
BEGIN NOW that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. END
BEGIN NOW Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. END
BEGIN NOW He's the END
BEGIN NOW only man in Dublin has it. END
BEGIN NOW A dark horse. END
BEGIN NOW —He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Mind, Joe, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Show us the entrance out. END
BEGIN NOW —There you are, says Terry. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. END
BEGIN NOW So I just went round the back of the END
BEGIN NOW yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was END
BEGIN NOW letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to END
BEGIN NOW myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in END
BEGIN NOW Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is END
BEGIN NOW five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was END
BEGIN NOW telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have END
BEGIN NOW done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's END
BEGIN NOW better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he END
BEGIN NOW won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my END
BEGIN NOW nation says he (hoik! END
BEGIN NOW phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the END
BEGIN NOW last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos. END
BEGIN NOW So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it END
BEGIN NOW was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper END
BEGIN NOW all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off END
BEGIN NOW of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk END
BEGIN NOW about selling Irish industries. END
BEGIN NOW Robbing Peter to pay Paul. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, that END
BEGIN NOW puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. END
BEGIN NOW Give us a bloody chance. END
BEGIN NOW God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody END
BEGIN NOW mouseabout. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. END
BEGIN NOW And his old fellow before END
BEGIN NOW him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that END
BEGIN NOW poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country END
BEGIN NOW with his baubles and his penny diamonds. END
BEGIN NOW Loans by post on easy terms. END
BEGIN NOW Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. END
BEGIN NOW Distance no object. END
BEGIN NOW No END
BEGIN NOW security. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the END
BEGIN NOW road with every one. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. END
BEGIN NOW And there's the man now that'll tell END
BEGIN NOW you all about it, Martin Cunningham. END
BEGIN NOW Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power END
BEGIN NOW with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the END
BEGIN NOW collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the END
BEGIN NOW registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the END
BEGIN NOW country at the king's expense. END
BEGIN NOW Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their END
BEGIN NOW palfreys. END
BEGIN NOW —Ho, varlet! END
BEGIN NOW cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. END
BEGIN NOW Saucy knave! END
BEGIN NOW To us! END
BEGIN NOW So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. END
BEGIN NOW Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard. END
BEGIN NOW —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow. END
BEGIN NOW —Bestir thyself, sirrah! END
BEGIN NOW cried he who had knocked. END
BEGIN NOW Look to our steeds. END
BEGIN NOW And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. END
BEGIN NOW —Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare END
BEGIN NOW larder. END
BEGIN NOW I know not what to offer your lordships. END
BEGIN NOW —How now, fellow? END
BEGIN NOW cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant END
BEGIN NOW countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun? END
BEGIN NOW An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage. END
BEGIN NOW —Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. END
BEGIN NOW An you be the king's END
BEGIN NOW messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my END
BEGIN NOW house I warrant me. END
BEGIN NOW —Then about! END
BEGIN NOW cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman END
BEGIN NOW by his aspect. END
BEGIN NOW Hast aught to give us? END
BEGIN NOW Mine host bowed again as he made answer: END
BEGIN NOW —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of END
BEGIN NOW venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head END
BEGIN NOW with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon END
BEGIN NOW of old Rhenish? END
BEGIN NOW —Gadzooks! END
BEGIN NOW cried the last speaker. END
BEGIN NOW That likes me well. END
BEGIN NOW Pistachios! END
BEGIN NOW —Aha! END
BEGIN NOW cried he of the pleasant countenance. END
BEGIN NOW A poor house and a bare END
BEGIN NOW larder, quotha! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a merry rogue. END
BEGIN NOW So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW —Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW Defrauding widows and orphans. END
BEGIN NOW —Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about END
BEGIN NOW Bloom and the Sinn Fein? END
BEGIN NOW —That's so, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW Or so they allege. END
BEGIN NOW —Who made those allegations? END
BEGIN NOW says Alf. END
BEGIN NOW —I, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the alligator. END
BEGIN NOW —And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like END
BEGIN NOW the next fellow? END
BEGIN NOW —Why not? END
BEGIN NOW says J. END
BEGIN NOW J., when he's quite sure which country it is. END
BEGIN NOW —Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell END
BEGIN NOW is he? END
BEGIN NOW says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW Or who is he? END
BEGIN NOW No offence, Crofton. END
BEGIN NOW —Who is Junius? END
BEGIN NOW says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW —We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian. END
BEGIN NOW —He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was END
BEGIN NOW he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. END
BEGIN NOW We know that END
BEGIN NOW in the castle. END
BEGIN NOW —Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? END
BEGIN NOW says Jack Power. END
BEGIN NOW —Not at all, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW Only namesakes. END
BEGIN NOW His name was Virag, the END
BEGIN NOW father's name that poisoned himself. END
BEGIN NOW He changed it by deedpoll, the END
BEGIN NOW father did. END
BEGIN NOW —That's the new Messiah for Ireland! END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Island of saints END
BEGIN NOW and sages! END
BEGIN NOW —Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW For that END
BEGIN NOW matter so are we. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J., and every male that's born they think it may be their END
BEGIN NOW Messiah. END
BEGIN NOW And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till END
BEGIN NOW he knows if he's a father or a mother. END
BEGIN NOW —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan. END
BEGIN NOW —O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his END
BEGIN NOW that died was born. END
BEGIN NOW I met him one day in the south city markets buying a END
BEGIN NOW tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered. END
BEGIN NOW —En ventre sa mÃ¨re, says J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you call that a man? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power. END
BEGIN NOW —And who does he suspect? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. END
BEGIN NOW One of those mixed END
BEGIN NOW middlings he is. END
BEGIN NOW Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a END
BEGIN NOW month with headache like a totty with her courses. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what I'm END
BEGIN NOW telling you? END
BEGIN NOW It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like END
BEGIN NOW of that and throw him in the bloody sea. END
BEGIN NOW Justifiable homicide, so it END
BEGIN NOW would. END
BEGIN NOW Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of END
BEGIN NOW stuff like a man. END
BEGIN NOW Give us your blessing. END
BEGIN NOW Not as much as would blind your END
BEGIN NOW eye. END
BEGIN NOW —Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW But where is he? END
BEGIN NOW We can't wait. END
BEGIN NOW —A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW That's what he is. END
BEGIN NOW Virag END
BEGIN NOW from Hungary! END
BEGIN NOW Ahasuerus I call him. END
BEGIN NOW Cursed by God. END
BEGIN NOW —Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? END
BEGIN NOW says Ned. END
BEGIN NOW —Only one, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW We must be quick. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW and S. END
BEGIN NOW —You, Jack? END
BEGIN NOW Crofton? END
BEGIN NOW Three half ones, Terry. END
BEGIN NOW —Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our END
BEGIN NOW shores. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. END
BEGIN NOW God bless all here is my END
BEGIN NOW prayer. END
BEGIN NOW —Amen, says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —And I'm sure He will, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with END
BEGIN NOW acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and END
BEGIN NOW subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors END
BEGIN NOW and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, END

BEGIN NOW And last, beneath a END

BEGIN NOW Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo END

BEGIN NOW the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and END
BEGIN NOW prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of END

BEGIN NOW And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the END

BEGIN NOW —Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini. END
BEGIN NOW —Qui fecit cÅ“lum et terram. END
BEGIN NOW —Dominus vobiscum. END

BEGIN NOW —Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW —Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. END
BEGIN NOW And butter for fish. END
BEGIN NOW I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when END
BEGIN NOW be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW —I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. END
BEGIN NOW I hope END
BEGIN NOW I'm not... END
BEGIN NOW —No, says Martin, we're ready. END
BEGIN NOW Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. END
BEGIN NOW Mean bloody scut. END

BEGIN NOW Devil a sweet fear! END
BEGIN NOW There's a END

BEGIN NOW —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, END
BEGIN NOW —Beg your pardon, says he. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. END
BEGIN NOW Come along now. END
BEGIN NOW —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. END
BEGIN NOW It's a END
BEGIN NOW secret. END
BEGIN NOW And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl. END
BEGIN NOW —Bye bye all, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or END
BEGIN NOW whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all END
BEGIN NOW at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car. END
BEGIN NOW —-Off with you, says END
BEGIN NOW Martin to the jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the END
BEGIN NOW helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward END
BEGIN NOW with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. END
BEGIN NOW A many comely nymphs drew END
BEGIN NOW nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the END
BEGIN NOW noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning END
BEGIN NOW wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the END
BEGIN NOW equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them END
BEGIN NOW all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they END
BEGIN NOW ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. END
BEGIN NOW Even so did END
BEGIN NOW they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the END
BEGIN NOW waves. END
BEGIN NOW But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the END
BEGIN NOW citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the END
BEGIN NOW dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and END
BEGIN NOW candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf END
BEGIN NOW round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him. END
BEGIN NOW —Let me alone, says he. END
BEGIN NOW And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls END
BEGIN NOW out of him: END
BEGIN NOW —Three cheers for Israel! END
BEGIN NOW Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake END
BEGIN NOW and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, there's END
BEGIN NOW always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about END
BEGIN NOW bloody nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it END
BEGIN NOW would. END
BEGIN NOW And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and END
BEGIN NOW Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf END
BEGIN NOW and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the END
BEGIN NOW loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit END
BEGIN NOW down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over END
BEGIN NOW his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a END
BEGIN NOW slut shouts out of her: END
BEGIN NOW —Eh, mister! END
BEGIN NOW Your fly is open, mister! END
BEGIN NOW And says he: END
BEGIN NOW —Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. END
BEGIN NOW And the END
BEGIN NOW Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Your God. END
BEGIN NOW —He had no father, says Martin. END
BEGIN NOW That'll do now. END
BEGIN NOW Drive ahead. END
BEGIN NOW —Whose God? END
BEGIN NOW says the citizen. END
BEGIN NOW —Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Your God was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Christ was a END
BEGIN NOW jew like me. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop. END
BEGIN NOW —By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy END
BEGIN NOW name. END
BEGIN NOW By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. END
BEGIN NOW Give us that biscuitbox here. END
BEGIN NOW —Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the END
BEGIN NOW metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid END
BEGIN NOW farewell to NagyasÃ¡gos uram LipÃ³ti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander END
BEGIN NOW Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for END
BEGIN NOW the distant clime of SzÃ¡zharminczbrojÃºgulyÃ¡s-DugulÃ¡s (Meadow of END
BEGIN NOW Murmuring Waters). END
BEGIN NOW The ceremony which went off with great Ã©clat was END
BEGIN NOW characterised by the most affecting cordiality. END
BEGIN NOW An illuminated scroll of END
BEGIN NOW ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the END
BEGIN NOW distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the END
BEGIN NOW community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully END
BEGIN NOW executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects END
BEGIN NOW every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. END
BEGIN NOW The departing guest END
BEGIN NOW was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present END
BEGIN NOW being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up END
BEGIN NOW the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by END
BEGIN NOW RakÃ³czsy's March. END
BEGIN NOW Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the END
BEGIN NOW coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three END
BEGIN NOW Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the END
BEGIN NOW Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the END
BEGIN NOW Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, END
BEGIN NOW Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Amid cheers that rent the welkin, END
BEGIN NOW responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the END
BEGIN NOW distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship END
BEGIN NOW slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the END
BEGIN NOW representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, END
BEGIN NOW as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the END
BEGIN NOW flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as END
BEGIN NOW were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and END
BEGIN NOW the Poolbeg Light. END
BEGIN NOW VisszontlÃ¡tÃ¡sra, kedvÃ©s barÃ¡tom! END
BEGIN NOW VisszontlÃ¡tÃ¡sra! END
BEGIN NOW Gone but not forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin END
BEGIN NOW anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he END
BEGIN NOW shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's END
BEGIN NOW royal theatre: END
BEGIN NOW —Where is he till I murder him? END
BEGIN NOW And Ned and J. END
BEGIN NOW J. END
BEGIN NOW paralysed with the laughing. END
BEGIN NOW —Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel. END
BEGIN NOW But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other END
BEGIN NOW way and off with him. END
BEGIN NOW —Hold on, citizen, says Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. END
BEGIN NOW Mercy of God the END
BEGIN NOW sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. END
BEGIN NOW Gob, he near sent it END
BEGIN NOW into the county Longford. END
BEGIN NOW The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel END
BEGIN NOW after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and END
BEGIN NOW laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street. END
BEGIN NOW The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth END
BEGIN NOW grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar END
BEGIN NOW seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year END
BEGIN NOW of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW The epicentre appears to have been END
BEGIN NOW that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and END
BEGIN NOW parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods END
BEGIN NOW and one square pole or perch. END
BEGIN NOW All the lordly residences in the vicinity END
BEGIN NOW of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, END
BEGIN NOW in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in END
BEGIN NOW progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared END
BEGIN NOW all the occupants have been buried alive. END
BEGIN NOW From the reports of END
BEGIN NOW eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a END
BEGIN NOW violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. END
BEGIN NOW An article of END
BEGIN NOW headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the END
BEGIN NOW crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle END
BEGIN NOW with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the END
BEGIN NOW erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick END
BEGIN NOW Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in END
BEGIN NOW remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third END
BEGIN NOW basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the END
BEGIN NOW extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near END
BEGIN NOW the old head of Kinsale. END
BEGIN NOW Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an END
BEGIN NOW incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the END
BEGIN NOW atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest END
BEGIN NOW by west. END
BEGIN NOW Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received END
BEGIN NOW from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has END
BEGIN NOW been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis END
BEGIN NOW shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every END

BEGIN NOW Gob, if he got that END

BEGIN NOW would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and END

BEGIN NOW The jarvey saved his life by END

BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW O, Jesus, he did. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW he let a volley of oaths after him. END
BEGIN NOW —Did I kill him, says he, or what? END
BEGIN NOW And he shouting to the bloody dog: END

BEGIN NOW After him, boy! END
BEGIN NOW And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old END

BEGIN NOW in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel. END
BEGIN NOW [ 13 ] END
BEGIN NOW The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious END

BEGIN NOW Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of END

BEGIN NOW and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and END
BEGIN NOW spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with END
BEGIN NOW bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. END
BEGIN NOW They were dabbling in END
BEGIN NOW the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, END
BEGIN NOW or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while END
BEGIN NOW that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. END
BEGIN NOW He was but eleven END
BEGIN NOW months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just END
BEGIN NOW beginning to lisp his first babyish words. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey bent over to END
BEGIN NOW him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin. END
BEGIN NOW —Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. END
BEGIN NOW Say out big, big. END
BEGIN NOW I want a drink of END
BEGIN NOW water. END
BEGIN NOW And baby prattled after her: END
BEGIN NOW —A jink a jink a jawbo. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, END
BEGIN NOW so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to END
BEGIN NOW take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and END
BEGIN NOW promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden END
BEGIN NOW syrup on. END
BEGIN NOW What a persuasive power that girl had! END
BEGIN NOW But to be sure baby END
BEGIN NOW Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy END
BEGIN NOW bib. END
BEGIN NOW None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy END
BEGIN NOW Caffrey. END
BEGIN NOW A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with END
BEGIN NOW a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe END
BEGIN NOW red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. END
BEGIN NOW And Edy Boardman laughed too at END
BEGIN NOW the quaint language of little brother. END
BEGIN NOW But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and END
BEGIN NOW Master Jacky. END
BEGIN NOW Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to END
BEGIN NOW this golden rule. END
BEGIN NOW The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand END
BEGIN NOW which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go END
BEGIN NOW wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the END
BEGIN NOW Martello tower had. END
BEGIN NOW But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was END
BEGIN NOW selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house END
BEGIN NOW is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the END
BEGIN NOW wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the END
BEGIN NOW attention of the girl friends. END
BEGIN NOW —Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. END
BEGIN NOW At once! END
BEGIN NOW And you, END
BEGIN NOW Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till I END
BEGIN NOW catch you for that. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their END
BEGIN NOW big sister's word was law with the twins. END
BEGIN NOW And in a sad plight he was too END
BEGIN NOW after his misadventure. END
BEGIN NOW His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables END
BEGIN NOW were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing END
BEGIN NOW over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to END
BEGIN NOW be seen on his smart little suit. END
BEGIN NOW Still the blue eyes were glistening END
BEGIN NOW with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and END
BEGIN NOW shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him END
BEGIN NOW she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition. END
BEGIN NOW —Nasty bold Jacky! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: END
BEGIN NOW —What's your name? END
BEGIN NOW Butter and cream? END
BEGIN NOW —Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. END
BEGIN NOW Is Cissy your END
BEGIN NOW sweetheart? END
BEGIN NOW —Nao, tearful Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW —Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? END
BEGIN NOW Cissy queried. END
BEGIN NOW —Nao, Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW —I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her END
BEGIN NOW shortsighted eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty is Tommy's END
BEGIN NOW sweetheart. END
BEGIN NOW —Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy END
BEGIN NOW Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman END
BEGIN NOW couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes. END
BEGIN NOW But who was Gerty? END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, END
BEGIN NOW gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen END
BEGIN NOW of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. END
BEGIN NOW She was pronounced END
BEGIN NOW beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more END
BEGIN NOW a Giltrap than a MacDowell. END
BEGIN NOW Her figure was slight and graceful, END
BEGIN NOW inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking END
BEGIN NOW of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's END
BEGIN NOW female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get END
BEGIN NOW and that tired feeling. END
BEGIN NOW The waxen pallor of her face was almost END
BEGIN NOW spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine END
BEGIN NOW Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Her hands were of finely veined alabaster END
BEGIN NOW with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments END
BEGIN NOW could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves END
BEGIN NOW in bed or take a milk footbath either. END
BEGIN NOW Bertha Supple told that once to END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn END
BEGIN NOW with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to END
BEGIN NOW time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever END
BEGIN NOW she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Honour where honour is due. END
BEGIN NOW There was an innate refinement, a END
BEGIN NOW languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in END
BEGIN NOW her delicate hands and higharched instep. END
BEGIN NOW Had kind fate but willed her END
BEGIN NOW to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she END
BEGIN NOW only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might END
BEGIN NOW easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen END
BEGIN NOW herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors END
BEGIN NOW at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. END
BEGIN NOW Mayhap END
BEGIN NOW it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her END
BEGIN NOW softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, END
BEGIN NOW that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm END
BEGIN NOW few could resist. END
BEGIN NOW Why have women such eyes of witchery? END
BEGIN NOW Gerty's were of END
BEGIN NOW the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive END
BEGIN NOW brows. END
BEGIN NOW Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. END
BEGIN NOW It was END
BEGIN NOW Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the END
BEGIN NOW Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which END
BEGIN NOW gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of END
BEGIN NOW fashion, and she had never regretted it. END
BEGIN NOW Then there was blushing END
BEGIN NOW scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you END
BEGIN NOW have a beautiful face but your nose? END
BEGIN NOW That would suit Mrs Dignam because END
BEGIN NOW she had a button one. END
BEGIN NOW But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of END
BEGIN NOW wonderful hair. END
BEGIN NOW It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. END
BEGIN NOW She had cut END
BEGIN NOW it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her END
BEGIN NOW pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails END
BEGIN NOW too, Thursday for wealth. END
BEGIN NOW And just now at Edy's words as a telltale END
BEGIN NOW flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she END
BEGIN NOW looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's END
BEGIN NOW fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal. END
BEGIN NOW For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She was END
BEGIN NOW about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. END
BEGIN NOW The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into END
BEGIN NOW a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May END
BEGIN NOW morning. END
BEGIN NOW She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say END
BEGIN NOW that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a END
BEGIN NOW lovers' quarrel. END
BEGIN NOW As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the END
BEGIN NOW boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and END
BEGIN NOW down in front of her window. END
BEGIN NOW Only now his father kept him in in the END
BEGIN NOW evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was END
BEGIN NOW on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when END
BEGIN NOW he left the high school like his brother W. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW Wylie who was racing in END
BEGIN NOW the bicycle races in Trinity college university. END
BEGIN NOW Little recked he END
BEGIN NOW perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, END
BEGIN NOW piercing to the core. END
BEGIN NOW Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to END
BEGIN NOW love her in time. END
BEGIN NOW They were protestants in his family and of course END
BEGIN NOW Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then END
BEGIN NOW Saint Joseph. END
BEGIN NOW But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and END
BEGIN NOW he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too END
BEGIN NOW at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something END
BEGIN NOW off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his END
BEGIN NOW hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes END
BEGIN NOW and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy END
BEGIN NOW Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and END
BEGIN NOW ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of END
BEGIN NOW Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it END
BEGIN NOW was expected in the Lady's Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) END
BEGIN NOW with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in END
BEGIN NOW which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite END
BEGIN NOW perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy END
BEGIN NOW threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure END
BEGIN NOW to perfection. END
BEGIN NOW She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved END
BEGIN NOW nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and END
BEGIN NOW at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. END
BEGIN NOW All Tuesday week afternoon END
BEGIN NOW she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she END
BEGIN NOW wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you END
BEGIN NOW would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. END
BEGIN NOW She did it up all by END
BEGIN NOW herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the END
BEGIN NOW lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! END
BEGIN NOW And when she put it END
BEGIN NOW on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the END
BEGIN NOW shine out of some people she knew. END
BEGIN NOW Her shoes were the newest thing in END
BEGIN NOW footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she END
BEGIN NOW never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak END
BEGIN NOW or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her END
BEGIN NOW higharched instep. END
BEGIN NOW Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect END
BEGIN NOW proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of END
BEGIN NOW her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and END
BEGIN NOW wide garter tops. END
BEGIN NOW As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who END
BEGIN NOW that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though END
BEGIN NOW Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame END
BEGIN NOW her? END
BEGIN NOW She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three END
BEGIN NOW garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different END
BEGIN NOW coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired END
BEGIN NOW them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed END
BEGIN NOW them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't END
BEGIN NOW trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. END
BEGIN NOW She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour END
BEGIN NOW and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because END
BEGIN NOW the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father END
BEGIN NOW brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she END
BEGIN NOW thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that END
BEGIN NOW morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that END
BEGIN NOW was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside out END
BEGIN NOW or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it END
BEGIN NOW wasn't of a Friday. END
BEGIN NOW And yet and yet! END
BEGIN NOW That strained look on her face! END
BEGIN NOW A gnawing sorrow is END
BEGIN NOW there all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give END
BEGIN NOW worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving END
BEGIN NOW way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup END
BEGIN NOW feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before END
BEGIN NOW the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW You are lovely, Gerty, it said. END
BEGIN NOW The paly light of evening END
BEGIN NOW falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell yearns in END
BEGIN NOW vain. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a END
BEGIN NOW marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy END
BEGIN NOW Wylie T. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW D. END
BEGIN NOW (because the one who married the elder brother would be END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was END
BEGIN NOW wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox END
BEGIN NOW was not to be. END
BEGIN NOW He was too young to understand. END
BEGIN NOW He would not believe in END
BEGIN NOW love, a woman's birthright. END
BEGIN NOW The night of the party long ago in Stoer's END
BEGIN NOW (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an END
BEGIN NOW arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. END
BEGIN NOW He called her END
BEGIN NOW little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the END
BEGIN NOW first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from END
BEGIN NOW the room with a remark about refreshments. END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous fellow! END
BEGIN NOW Strength of END
BEGIN NOW character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo END
BEGIN NOW and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. END
BEGIN NOW But waiting, always END
BEGIN NOW waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. END
BEGIN NOW No END
BEGIN NOW prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her END
BEGIN NOW feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found END
BEGIN NOW his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would END
BEGIN NOW understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all END
BEGIN NOW the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long END
BEGIN NOW long kiss. END
BEGIN NOW It would be like heaven. END
BEGIN NOW For such a one she yearns this balmy END
BEGIN NOW summer eve. END
BEGIN NOW With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his END
BEGIN NOW affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death END
BEGIN NOW us two part, from this to this day forward. END
BEGIN NOW And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was END
BEGIN NOW just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his END
BEGIN NOW little wife to be. END
BEGIN NOW Then they could talk about her till they went blue in END
BEGIN NOW the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would END
BEGIN NOW be twentytwo in November. END
BEGIN NOW She would care for him with creature comforts END
BEGIN NOW too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that END
BEGIN NOW feeling of hominess. END
BEGIN NOW Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and END
BEGIN NOW queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions END
BEGIN NOW from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge END
BEGIN NOW in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, END
BEGIN NOW then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though END
BEGIN NOW she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her END
BEGIN NOW shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like END
BEGIN NOW violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom END
BEGIN NOW with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's END
BEGIN NOW lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz END
BEGIN NOW covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble END
BEGIN NOW sales like they have in rich houses. END
BEGIN NOW He would be tall with broad END
BEGIN NOW shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with END
BEGIN NOW glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache END
BEGIN NOW and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful END
BEGIN NOW weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little END
BEGIN NOW homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but END
BEGIN NOW perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to END
BEGIN NOW business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze END
BEGIN NOW for a moment deep down into her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she END
BEGIN NOW buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off END
BEGIN NOW and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. END
BEGIN NOW But Tommy said END
BEGIN NOW he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the END
BEGIN NOW ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it END
BEGIN NOW was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you END
BEGIN NOW please. END
BEGIN NOW The temper of him! END
BEGIN NOW O, he was a man already was little Tommy END
BEGIN NOW Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. END
BEGIN NOW Edy told him no, no and to be off END
BEGIN NOW now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. END
BEGIN NOW —You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. END
BEGIN NOW It's my ball. END
BEGIN NOW But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her END
BEGIN NOW finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and END
BEGIN NOW Tommy after it in full career, having won the day. END
BEGIN NOW —Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW And she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played END
BEGIN NOW here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread END
BEGIN NOW carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper END
BEGIN NOW chin. END
BEGIN NOW But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way END
BEGIN NOW like that from everyone always petting him. END
BEGIN NOW —I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't END
BEGIN NOW say. END
BEGIN NOW —On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy END
BEGIN NOW saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her END
BEGIN NOW life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was END
BEGIN NOW sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. END
BEGIN NOW But not a pin cared END
BEGIN NOW Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW —Let him! END
BEGIN NOW she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of END
BEGIN NOW her nose. END
BEGIN NOW Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at END
BEGIN NOW him. END
BEGIN NOW Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. END
BEGIN NOW You had to laugh at her sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and END
BEGIN NOW jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her END
BEGIN NOW nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go END
BEGIN NOW where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss END
BEGIN NOW White. END
BEGIN NOW That was just like Cissycums. END
BEGIN NOW O, and will you ever forget her the END
BEGIN NOW evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork END
BEGIN NOW moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW There END
BEGIN NOW was none to come up to her for fun. END
BEGIN NOW But she was sincerity itself, one of END
BEGIN NOW the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced END
BEGIN NOW things, too sweet to be wholesome. END
BEGIN NOW And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing END
BEGIN NOW anthem of the organ. END
BEGIN NOW It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by END
BEGIN NOW the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. END
BEGIN NOW J., rosary, sermon and END
BEGIN NOW benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. END
BEGIN NOW They were there gathered END
BEGIN NOW together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying END
BEGIN NOW spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the END
BEGIN NOW storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, END
BEGIN NOW reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede END
BEGIN NOW for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. END
BEGIN NOW How END
BEGIN NOW sad to poor Gerty's ears! END
BEGIN NOW Had her father only avoided the clutches of END
BEGIN NOW the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit END
BEGIN NOW cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, END
BEGIN NOW second to none. END
BEGIN NOW Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by END
BEGIN NOW the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two END
BEGIN NOW lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at END
BEGIN NOW the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. END
BEGIN NOW But that vile decoction END
BEGIN NOW which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her END
BEGIN NOW childhood days. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of END
BEGIN NOW violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to END
BEGIN NOW the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was END
BEGIN NOW one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts END
BEGIN NOW his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded END
BEGIN NOW as the lowest of the low. END
BEGIN NOW And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, END
BEGIN NOW Virgin most merciful. END
BEGIN NOW And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard END
BEGIN NOW her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off END
BEGIN NOW Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like END
BEGIN NOW himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. END
BEGIN NOW You never saw him END
BEGIN NOW any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a END
BEGIN NOW father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it END
BEGIN NOW was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the END
BEGIN NOW pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. END
BEGIN NOW Poor END
BEGIN NOW father! END
BEGIN NOW With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, END
BEGIN NOW Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had END
BEGIN NOW stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and END
BEGIN NOW when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and END
BEGIN NOW was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother's birthday END
BEGIN NOW that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and END
BEGIN NOW Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. END
BEGIN NOW No-one would have thought the end was so near. END
BEGIN NOW Now he was laid to rest. END
BEGIN NOW And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest END
BEGIN NOW of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the END
BEGIN NOW gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples END
BEGIN NOW from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic, standard designs, END
BEGIN NOW fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the END
BEGIN NOW home. END
BEGIN NOW A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the END
BEGIN NOW house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in END
BEGIN NOW gold. END
BEGIN NOW And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was END
BEGIN NOW it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't END
BEGIN NOW like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single END
BEGIN NOW thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone thought the END
BEGIN NOW world of her for her gentle ways. END
BEGIN NOW It was Gerty who turned off the gas at END
BEGIN NOW the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that END
BEGIN NOW place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr END
BEGIN NOW Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where END
BEGIN NOW a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a END
BEGIN NOW threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with END
BEGIN NOW oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. END
BEGIN NOW You could see there was a END
BEGIN NOW story behind it. END
BEGIN NOW The colours were done something lovely. END
BEGIN NOW She was in a END
BEGIN NOW soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in END
BEGIN NOW chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. END
BEGIN NOW She often looked at them END
BEGIN NOW dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms END
BEGIN NOW that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and END
BEGIN NOW thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's END
BEGIN NOW pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the END
BEGIN NOW halcyon days what they meant. END
BEGIN NOW The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till END
BEGIN NOW at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no END
BEGIN NOW getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he END
BEGIN NOW could down towards the seaweedy rocks. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say poor Tommy was END
BEGIN NOW not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was END
BEGIN NOW sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted END
BEGIN NOW the ball. END
BEGIN NOW Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and END
BEGIN NOW to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to END
BEGIN NOW her please. END
BEGIN NOW The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it END
BEGIN NOW up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and END
BEGIN NOW stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let END
BEGIN NOW them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their END
BEGIN NOW stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she END
BEGIN NOW missed and Edy and Cissy laughed. END
BEGIN NOW —If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. END
BEGIN NOW A delicate pink crept into her END
BEGIN NOW pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted END
BEGIN NOW her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a END
BEGIN NOW jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down END
BEGIN NOW towards the shingle. END
BEGIN NOW Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw END
BEGIN NOW attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. END
BEGIN NOW She felt the END
BEGIN NOW warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and END
BEGIN NOW flaming into her cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW Till then they had only exchanged glances of END
BEGIN NOW the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a END
BEGIN NOW look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan END
BEGIN NOW and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen. END
BEGIN NOW Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted END
BEGIN NOW and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of END
BEGIN NOW original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for END
BEGIN NOW us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many END
BEGIN NOW who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all END
BEGIN NOW that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told END
BEGIN NOW them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the END
BEGIN NOW most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any END
BEGIN NOW age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned END

BEGIN NOW The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of END
BEGIN NOW childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey played with END
BEGIN NOW baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. END
BEGIN NOW Peep END
BEGIN NOW she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy END
BEGIN NOW gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! END
BEGIN NOW and, my word, END
BEGIN NOW didn't the little chap enjoy that! END
BEGIN NOW And then she told him to say papa. END
BEGIN NOW —Say papa, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa. END
BEGIN NOW And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for END
BEGIN NOW eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of END
BEGIN NOW health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out END
BEGIN NOW to be something great, they said. END
BEGIN NOW —Haja ja ja haja. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to END
BEGIN NOW sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried END
BEGIN NOW out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half END
BEGIN NOW blanket the other way under him. END
BEGIN NOW Of course his infant majesty was most END
BEGIN NOW obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: END
BEGIN NOW —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa. END
BEGIN NOW And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW It was all END
BEGIN NOW no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the END
BEGIN NOW geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him END
BEGIN NOW in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was END
BEGIN NOW quickly appeased. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out END
BEGIN NOW of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little END
BEGIN NOW brats of twins. END
BEGIN NOW She gazed out towards the distant sea. END
BEGIN NOW It was like the END
BEGIN NOW paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured END
BEGIN NOW chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the END
BEGIN NOW evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to END
BEGIN NOW hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in END
BEGIN NOW the church like a kind of waft. END
BEGIN NOW And while she gazed her heart went END
BEGIN NOW pitapat. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his END
BEGIN NOW look. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through END
BEGIN NOW and through, read her very soul. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful eyes they were, superbly END
BEGIN NOW expressive, but could you trust them? END
BEGIN NOW People were so queer. END
BEGIN NOW She could END
BEGIN NOW see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was END
BEGIN NOW a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the END
BEGIN NOW matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she END
BEGIN NOW wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always END
BEGIN NOW dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had END
BEGIN NOW an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussÃ© from where he was sitting. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting END
BEGIN NOW sorrow was written on his face. END
BEGIN NOW She would have given worlds to know what END
BEGIN NOW it was. END
BEGIN NOW He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the END
BEGIN NOW ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if END
BEGIN NOW she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. END
BEGIN NOW She was glad END
BEGIN NOW that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking END
BEGIN NOW Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. END
BEGIN NOW Here was that of which END
BEGIN NOW she had so often dreamed. END
BEGIN NOW It was he who mattered and there was joy on END
BEGIN NOW her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he END
BEGIN NOW was like no-one else. END
BEGIN NOW The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, END
BEGIN NOW her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. END
BEGIN NOW If he had END
BEGIN NOW suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had END
BEGIN NOW been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. END
BEGIN NOW Even if he was a END
BEGIN NOW protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved END
BEGIN NOW her. END
BEGIN NOW There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. END
BEGIN NOW She was a END
BEGIN NOW womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, END
BEGIN NOW those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to END
BEGIN NOW know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, END
BEGIN NOW make him forget the memory of the past. END
BEGIN NOW Then mayhap he would embrace her END
BEGIN NOW gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, END
BEGIN NOW his ownest girlie, for herself alone. END
BEGIN NOW Refuge of sinners. END
BEGIN NOW Comfortress of the afflicted. END
BEGIN NOW Ora pro nobis. END
BEGIN NOW Well has END
BEGIN NOW it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can END
BEGIN NOW never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for END
BEGIN NOW the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own END
BEGIN NOW heart. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained END
BEGIN NOW glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners END
BEGIN NOW of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon END
BEGIN NOW O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast END
BEGIN NOW down. END
BEGIN NOW He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and END
BEGIN NOW clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she END
BEGIN NOW became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the END
BEGIN NOW convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. END
BEGIN NOW He told her that time when she END
BEGIN NOW told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her END
BEGIN NOW hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the END
BEGIN NOW voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in END
BEGIN NOW this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of END
BEGIN NOW woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said END
BEGIN NOW to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could END
BEGIN NOW she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a END
BEGIN NOW present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece END
BEGIN NOW white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell END
BEGIN NOW the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours' END
BEGIN NOW adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or END
BEGIN NOW perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place. END
BEGIN NOW The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky END
BEGIN NOW threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. END
BEGIN NOW Little END
BEGIN NOW monkeys common as ditchwater. END
BEGIN NOW Someone ought to take them and give them a END
BEGIN NOW good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of END
BEGIN NOW them. END
BEGIN NOW And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they END
BEGIN NOW were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned. END
BEGIN NOW —Jacky! END
BEGIN NOW Tommy! END
BEGIN NOW Not they! END
BEGIN NOW What a great notion they had! END
BEGIN NOW So Cissy said it was the very END
BEGIN NOW last time she'd ever bring them out. END
BEGIN NOW She jumped up and called them and END
BEGIN NOW she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a END
BEGIN NOW good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the END
BEGIN NOW thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow END
BEGIN NOW long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up END
BEGIN NOW her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot END
BEGIN NOW of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever END
BEGIN NOW she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was END
BEGIN NOW a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her END
BEGIN NOW petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. END
BEGIN NOW It would END
BEGIN NOW have served her just right if she had tripped up over something END
BEGIN NOW accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to END
BEGIN NOW make her look tall and got a fine tumble. END
BEGIN NOW Tableau! END
BEGIN NOW That would have been END
BEGIN NOW a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness. END
BEGIN NOW Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, END
BEGIN NOW they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed END
BEGIN NOW the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the END
BEGIN NOW Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was END
BEGIN NOW itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't END
BEGIN NOW because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger END
BEGIN NOW mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he END
BEGIN NOW never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the END
BEGIN NOW thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed END
BEGIN NOW Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung END
BEGIN NOW her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer END
BEGIN NOW gosa cramen tum. END
BEGIN NOW Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in END
BEGIN NOW Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter END
BEGIN NOW and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, END
BEGIN NOW transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape END
BEGIN NOW nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the END
BEGIN NOW difference for himself. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with END
BEGIN NOW her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a END
BEGIN NOW streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only END
BEGIN NOW a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat END
BEGIN NOW hanging like a caricature. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to END
BEGIN NOW settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was END
BEGIN NOW never seen on a girl's shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, END
BEGIN NOW almost maddening in its sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW You would have to travel many a long END
BEGIN NOW mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. END
BEGIN NOW She could almost END
BEGIN NOW see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her END
BEGIN NOW tingling in every nerve. END
BEGIN NOW She put on her hat so that she could see from END
BEGIN NOW underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath END
BEGIN NOW caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He was eying her as a END
BEGIN NOW snake eyes its prey. END
BEGIN NOW Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised END
BEGIN NOW the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat END
BEGIN NOW to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose. END
BEGIN NOW Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, END
BEGIN NOW half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the END
BEGIN NOW baby. END
BEGIN NOW Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why END
BEGIN NOW no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of END
BEGIN NOW hers. END
BEGIN NOW And she said to Gerty: END
BEGIN NOW —A penny for your thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW —What? END
BEGIN NOW replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW was only wondering was it late. END
BEGIN NOW Because she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and END
BEGIN NOW their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just END
BEGIN NOW gave a gentle hint about its being late. END
BEGIN NOW And when Cissy came up Edy END
BEGIN NOW asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half END
BEGIN NOW past kissing time, time to kiss again. END
BEGIN NOW But Edy wanted to know because END
BEGIN NOW they were told to be in early. END
BEGIN NOW —Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the END
BEGIN NOW time by his conundrum. END
BEGIN NOW So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his END
BEGIN NOW hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his END
BEGIN NOW watchchain, looking up at the church. END
BEGIN NOW Passionate nature though he was END
BEGIN NOW Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. END
BEGIN NOW One moment he END
BEGIN NOW had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the END
BEGIN NOW next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed END
BEGIN NOW in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the END
BEGIN NOW right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it END
BEGIN NOW and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his END
BEGIN NOW watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun END
BEGIN NOW was set. END
BEGIN NOW His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in END
BEGIN NOW measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said END
BEGIN NOW his waterworks were out of order. END
BEGIN NOW Then they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O'Hanlon END
BEGIN NOW got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told END
BEGIN NOW Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the END
BEGIN NOW flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could END
BEGIN NOW see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she END
BEGIN NOW swung her leg more in and out in time. END
BEGIN NOW It was getting darker but he END
BEGIN NOW could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch END
BEGIN NOW or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands END
BEGIN NOW back into his pockets. END
BEGIN NOW She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over END
BEGIN NOW her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against END
BEGIN NOW her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too END
BEGIN NOW was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW His dark eyes END
BEGIN NOW fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally END
BEGIN NOW worshipping at her shrine. END
BEGIN NOW If ever there was undisguised admiration in a END
BEGIN NOW man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. END
BEGIN NOW It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it. END
BEGIN NOW Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty END
BEGIN NOW noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect END
BEGIN NOW because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place END
BEGIN NOW to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied END
BEGIN NOW their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood END
BEGIN NOW up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the END
BEGIN NOW card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy END
BEGIN NOW and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but END
BEGIN NOW Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with END
BEGIN NOW scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her END
BEGIN NOW best boy throwing her over. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty winced sharply. END
BEGIN NOW A brief cold blaze END
BEGIN NOW shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. END
BEGIN NOW It hurt—O END
BEGIN NOW yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like END
BEGIN NOW that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the END
BEGIN NOW sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully END
BEGIN NOW moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. END
BEGIN NOW She had loved him END
BEGIN NOW better than he knew. END
BEGIN NOW Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex END
BEGIN NOW he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant END
BEGIN NOW there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes were END
BEGIN NOW probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in END
BEGIN NOW sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. END
BEGIN NOW —O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head END
BEGIN NOW flashed up. END
BEGIN NOW I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year. END
BEGIN NOW Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the END
BEGIN NOW ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. END
BEGIN NOW There was that in her young END
BEGIN NOW voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. END
BEGIN NOW As END
BEGIN NOW for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck END
BEGIN NOW him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as END
BEGIN NOW much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen END
BEGIN NOW pieces. END
BEGIN NOW And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one END
BEGIN NOW look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Miss END
BEGIN NOW puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could END
BEGIN NOW see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering END
BEGIN NOW rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had END
BEGIN NOW struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was END
BEGIN NOW something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and END
BEGIN NOW never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it END
BEGIN NOW so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it. END
BEGIN NOW Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in END
BEGIN NOW the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the END
BEGIN NOW sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. END
BEGIN NOW And Cissy told him END
BEGIN NOW too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby END
BEGIN NOW looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy END
BEGIN NOW poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as END
BEGIN NOW much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to END
BEGIN NOW his brandnew dribbling bib. END
BEGIN NOW —O my! END
BEGIN NOW Puddeny pie! END
BEGIN NOW protested Ciss. END
BEGIN NOW He has his bib destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set END
BEGIN NOW that little matter to rights. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy END
BEGIN NOW asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was END
BEGIN NOW flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed END
BEGIN NOW it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction END
BEGIN NOW because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet END
BEGIN NOW seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that END
BEGIN NOW Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the END
BEGIN NOW Blessed Sacrament in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse END
BEGIN NOW of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time END
BEGIN NOW a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, END
BEGIN NOW thither, with a tiny lost cry. END
BEGIN NOW And she could see far away the lights of END
BEGIN NOW the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of END
BEGIN NOW paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter END
BEGIN NOW would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along END
BEGIN NOW by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the END
BEGIN NOW lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like END
BEGIN NOW she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel END
BEGIN NOW Vaughan and other tales. END
BEGIN NOW For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. END
BEGIN NOW She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple END
BEGIN NOW of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her END
BEGIN NOW thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though END
BEGIN NOW it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. END
BEGIN NOW It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell END
BEGIN NOW combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, END
BEGIN NOW her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came END
BEGIN NOW home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it END
BEGIN NOW in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame Street for she felt that END
BEGIN NOW she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that END
BEGIN NOW poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the END
BEGIN NOW newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. END
BEGIN NOW Art thou real, my END
BEGIN NOW ideal? END
BEGIN NOW it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was END
BEGIN NOW something about twilight, wilt thou ever? END
BEGIN NOW and ofttimes the beauty of END
BEGIN NOW poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with END
BEGIN NOW silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one END
BEGIN NOW by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no END
BEGIN NOW competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she END
BEGIN NOW always tried to conceal it. END
BEGIN NOW But it must end, she felt. END
BEGIN NOW If she saw that END
BEGIN NOW magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. END
BEGIN NOW Love END
BEGIN NOW laughs at locksmiths. END
BEGIN NOW She would make the great sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Her every END
BEGIN NOW effort would be to share his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Dearer than the whole world would END
BEGIN NOW she be to him and gild his days with happiness. END
BEGIN NOW There was the END
BEGIN NOW allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or END
BEGIN NOW a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with END
BEGIN NOW the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a END
BEGIN NOW madhouse, cruel only to be kind. END
BEGIN NOW But even if—what then? END
BEGIN NOW Would it make a END
BEGIN NOW very great difference? END
BEGIN NOW From everything in the least indelicate her END
BEGIN NOW finebred nature instinctively recoiled. END
BEGIN NOW She loathed that sort of person, END
BEGIN NOW the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went END
BEGIN NOW with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, END
BEGIN NOW degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. END
BEGIN NOW No, no: not END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister END
BEGIN NOW without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big END
BEGIN NOW ess. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days END
BEGIN NOW beyond recall. END
BEGIN NOW She thought she understood. END
BEGIN NOW She would try to understand END
BEGIN NOW him because men were so different. END
BEGIN NOW The old love was waiting, waiting END
BEGIN NOW with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Heart END
BEGIN NOW of mine! END
BEGIN NOW She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart END
BEGIN NOW that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for END
BEGIN NOW her for love was the master guide. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else mattered. END
BEGIN NOW Come what END
BEGIN NOW might she would be wild, untrammelled, free. END
BEGIN NOW Canon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and END
BEGIN NOW genuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he END
BEGIN NOW locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father END
BEGIN NOW Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she END
BEGIN NOW coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: END
BEGIN NOW —O, look, Cissy! END
BEGIN NOW And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the END
BEGIN NOW trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple. END
BEGIN NOW —It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said. END
BEGIN NOW And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, END
BEGIN NOW helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy END
BEGIN NOW holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running. END
BEGIN NOW —Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. END
BEGIN NOW It's the bazaar fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW But Gerty was adamant. END
BEGIN NOW She had no intention of being at their beck and END
BEGIN NOW call. END
BEGIN NOW If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could END
BEGIN NOW see from where she was. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes that were fastened upon her set her END
BEGIN NOW pulses tingling. END
BEGIN NOW She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a END
BEGIN NOW light broke in upon her. END
BEGIN NOW Whitehot passion was in that face, passion END
BEGIN NOW silent as the grave, and it had made her his. END
BEGIN NOW At last they were left END
BEGIN NOW alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could END
BEGIN NOW be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible END
BEGIN NOW honour to his fingertips. END
BEGIN NOW His hands and face were working and a tremour END
BEGIN NOW went over her. END
BEGIN NOW She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were END
BEGIN NOW and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up END
BEGIN NOW and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her END
BEGIN NOW graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately END
BEGIN NOW rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse END
BEGIN NOW breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, END
BEGIN NOW hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made END
BEGIN NOW her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with END
BEGIN NOW them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of END
BEGIN NOW papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do END
BEGIN NOW something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was END
BEGIN NOW all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to END
BEGIN NOW his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. END
BEGIN NOW Besides there END
BEGIN NOW was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being END
BEGIN NOW married and there ought to be women priests that would understand END
BEGIN NOW without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy END
BEGIN NOW kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny END
BEGIN NOW Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on END
BEGIN NOW account of that other thing coming on the way it did. END
BEGIN NOW And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back END
BEGIN NOW and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and END
BEGIN NOW they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she END
BEGIN NOW leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was END
BEGIN NOW flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. END
BEGIN NOW And she saw a END
BEGIN NOW long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense END
BEGIN NOW hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and END
BEGIN NOW higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, END
BEGIN NOW high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an END
BEGIN NOW entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things END
BEGIN NOW too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than END
BEGIN NOW those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being END
BEGIN NOW white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high END
BEGIN NOW it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from END
BEGIN NOW being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee END
BEGIN NOW where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed END
BEGIN NOW and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he END
BEGIN NOW couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like END
BEGIN NOW those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he END
BEGIN NOW kept on looking, looking. END
BEGIN NOW She would fain have cried to him chokingly, END
BEGIN NOW held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on END
BEGIN NOW her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry, END
BEGIN NOW wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. END
BEGIN NOW And then a END
BEGIN NOW rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! END
BEGIN NOW then the Roman candle END
BEGIN NOW burst and it was like a sigh of O! END
BEGIN NOW and everyone cried O! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW in raptures END
BEGIN NOW and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed END
BEGIN NOW and ah! END
BEGIN NOW they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so END
BEGIN NOW lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! END
BEGIN NOW Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of END
BEGIN NOW piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He END
BEGIN NOW was leaning back against the rock behind. END
BEGIN NOW Leopold Bloom (for it is he) END
BEGIN NOW stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. END
BEGIN NOW What a END
BEGIN NOW brute he had been! END
BEGIN NOW At it again? END
BEGIN NOW A fair unsullied soul had called to him END
BEGIN NOW and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? END
BEGIN NOW An utter cad he had been! END
BEGIN NOW He of all men! END
BEGIN NOW But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, END
BEGIN NOW for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and END
BEGIN NOW wandered. END
BEGIN NOW Should a girl tell? END
BEGIN NOW No, a thousand times no. END
BEGIN NOW That was their END
BEGIN NOW secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to END
BEGIN NOW know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening END
BEGIN NOW to and fro and little bats don't tell. END
BEGIN NOW Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show END
BEGIN NOW what a great person she was: and then she cried: END
BEGIN NOW —Gerty! END
BEGIN NOW Gerty! END
BEGIN NOW We're going. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW We can see from farther up. END
BEGIN NOW Gerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. END
BEGIN NOW She slipped a hand into END
BEGIN NOW her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of END
BEGIN NOW course without letting him and then slipped it back. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder if he's too END
BEGIN NOW far to. END
BEGIN NOW She rose. END
BEGIN NOW Was it goodbye? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She had to go but they would meet END
BEGIN NOW again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her END
BEGIN NOW dream of yester eve. END
BEGIN NOW She drew herself up to her full height. END
BEGIN NOW Their souls END
BEGIN NOW met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full END
BEGIN NOW of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged END
BEGIN NOW on tears, and then they parted. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, END
BEGIN NOW to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. END
BEGIN NOW It was END
BEGIN NOW darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and END
BEGIN NOW slippy seaweed. END
BEGIN NOW She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic END
BEGIN NOW of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell END
BEGIN NOW was... END
BEGIN NOW Tight boots? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She's lame! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. END
BEGIN NOW Poor girl! END
BEGIN NOW That's why she's END
BEGIN NOW left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. END
BEGIN NOW Thought something was END
BEGIN NOW wrong by the cut of her jib. END
BEGIN NOW Jilted beauty. END
BEGIN NOW A defect is ten times worse END
BEGIN NOW in a woman. END
BEGIN NOW But makes them polite. END
BEGIN NOW Glad I didn't know it when she was on END
BEGIN NOW show. END
BEGIN NOW Hot little devil all the same. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't mind. END
BEGIN NOW Curiosity like a END
BEGIN NOW nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. END
BEGIN NOW That squinty one is delicate. END
BEGIN NOW Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. END
BEGIN NOW I have such a END
BEGIN NOW bad headache today. END
BEGIN NOW Where did I put the letter? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, all right. END
BEGIN NOW All END
BEGIN NOW kinds of crazy longings. END
BEGIN NOW Licking pennies. END
BEGIN NOW Girl in Tranquilla convent END

BEGIN NOW Sister? END
BEGIN NOW How many women in Dublin have it today? END
BEGIN NOW Martha, she. END
BEGIN NOW Something in the air. END
BEGIN NOW That's the moon. END
BEGIN NOW But then why don't all women END
BEGIN NOW menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? END
BEGIN NOW Depends on the END
BEGIN NOW time they were born I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Or all start scratch then get out of END
BEGIN NOW step. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes Molly and Milly together. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow I got the best of that. END
BEGIN NOW Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I END

BEGIN NOW Made up for that tramdriver this morning. END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. END
BEGIN NOW And his wife engagement in the END

BEGIN NOW Thankful for small mercies. END
BEGIN NOW Cheap END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Yours for the asking. END
BEGIN NOW Because they want it themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Their END

BEGIN NOW Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. END
BEGIN NOW Reserve better. END
BEGIN NOW Don't want it they throw it at you. END
BEGIN NOW Catch em alive, O. END
BEGIN NOW Pity they can't see themselves. END
BEGIN NOW A dream of wellfilled hose. END

BEGIN NOW Felt for the curves inside END
BEGIN NOW her deshabillÃ©. END
BEGIN NOW Excites them also when they're. END
BEGIN NOW I'm all clean come and END
BEGIN NOW dirty me. END
BEGIN NOW And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Milly END
BEGIN NOW delighted with Molly's new blouse. END
BEGIN NOW At first. END
BEGIN NOW Put them all on to take END
BEGIN NOW them all off. END
BEGIN NOW Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Why I bought her the violet garters. END
BEGIN NOW Us too: the END

BEGIN NOW He wore a pair of END

BEGIN NOW Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she END

BEGIN NOW Pinned together. END
BEGIN NOW O, Mairy lost the pin of her. END
BEGIN NOW Dressed up to END
BEGIN NOW the nines for somebody. END
BEGIN NOW Fashion part of their charm. END
BEGIN NOW Just changes when END

BEGIN NOW No reasonable offer refused. END
BEGIN NOW She wasn't in a hurry either. END
BEGIN NOW Always END
BEGIN NOW off to a fellow when they are. END
BEGIN NOW They never forget an appointment. END
BEGIN NOW Out on END
BEGIN NOW spec probably. END
BEGIN NOW They believe in chance because like themselves. END
BEGIN NOW And the END
BEGIN NOW others inclined to give her an odd dig. END
BEGIN NOW Girl friends at school, arms END
BEGIN NOW round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and END
BEGIN NOW whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. END
BEGIN NOW Nuns with END
BEGIN NOW whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, END
BEGIN NOW vindictive too for what they can't get. END
BEGIN NOW Barbed wire. END
BEGIN NOW Be sure now and END

BEGIN NOW Molly and Josie END

BEGIN NOW O that way! END
BEGIN NOW O, that's exquisite! END
BEGIN NOW Feel it myself too. END
BEGIN NOW Good to rest END

BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Gently does it. END

BEGIN NOW Ought to END

BEGIN NOW Besides I can't be so if Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Took off her hat to show her END
BEGIN NOW hair. END
BEGIN NOW Wide brim. END
BEGIN NOW Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know END
BEGIN NOW her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. END
BEGIN NOW Hair strong in rut. END
BEGIN NOW Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles END
BEGIN NOW street. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he gave her money. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW All a prejudice. END
BEGIN NOW She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW I think so. END
BEGIN NOW All that for END
BEGIN NOW nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Bold hand: Mrs Marion. END
BEGIN NOW Did I forget to write address on that END
BEGIN NOW letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? END
BEGIN NOW And the day I went to END
BEGIN NOW Drimmie's without a necktie. END
BEGIN NOW Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. END
BEGIN NOW No, I END
BEGIN NOW remember. END
BEGIN NOW Richie Goulding: he's another. END
BEGIN NOW Weighs on his mind. END
BEGIN NOW Funny my END
BEGIN NOW watch stopped at half past four. END
BEGIN NOW Dust. END
BEGIN NOW Shark liver oil they use to END
BEGIN NOW clean. END
BEGIN NOW Could do it myself. END
BEGIN NOW Save. END
BEGIN NOW Was that just when he, she? END
BEGIN NOW O, he did. END
BEGIN NOW Into her. END
BEGIN NOW She did. END
BEGIN NOW Done. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. END
BEGIN NOW O Lord, that little END
BEGIN NOW limping devil. END
BEGIN NOW Begins to feel cold and clammy. END
BEGIN NOW Aftereffect not pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Still you have to get rid of it someway. END
BEGIN NOW They don't care. END
BEGIN NOW Complimented END
BEGIN NOW perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the END
BEGIN NOW kiddies. END
BEGIN NOW Well, aren't they? END
BEGIN NOW See her as she is spoil all. END
BEGIN NOW Must have the END
BEGIN NOW stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. END
BEGIN NOW The name too. END
BEGIN NOW Amours END

BEGIN NOW Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. END
BEGIN NOW Curtain up. END
BEGIN NOW Moonlight silver effulgence. END
BEGIN NOW Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. END
BEGIN NOW Little sweetheart come and kiss me. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I feel. END
BEGIN NOW The strength it gives END
BEGIN NOW a man. END
BEGIN NOW That's the secret of it. END
BEGIN NOW Good job I let off there behind the wall END
BEGIN NOW coming out of Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW Cider that was. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise I couldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW Makes END
BEGIN NOW you want to sing after. END
BEGIN NOW Lacaus esant taratara. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose I spoke to her. END
BEGIN NOW What about? END
BEGIN NOW Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the END
BEGIN NOW conversation. END
BEGIN NOW Ask them a question they ask you another. END
BEGIN NOW Good idea if END
BEGIN NOW you're stuck. END
BEGIN NOW Gain time. END
BEGIN NOW But then you're in a cart. END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful of course END
BEGIN NOW if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. END
BEGIN NOW O END
BEGIN NOW but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O END
BEGIN NOW thinking she was. END
BEGIN NOW Whew! END
BEGIN NOW Girl in Meath street that night. END
BEGIN NOW All the dirty END
BEGIN NOW things I made her say. END
BEGIN NOW All wrong of course. END
BEGIN NOW My arks she called it. END
BEGIN NOW It's END
BEGIN NOW so hard to find one who. END
BEGIN NOW Aho! END
BEGIN NOW If you don't answer when they solicit must END
BEGIN NOW be horrible for them till they harden. END
BEGIN NOW And kissed my hand when I gave END
BEGIN NOW her the extra two shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Parrots. END
BEGIN NOW Press the button and the bird will END
BEGIN NOW squeak. END
BEGIN NOW Wish she hadn't called me sir. END
BEGIN NOW O, her mouth in the dark! END
BEGIN NOW And you END
BEGIN NOW a married man with a single girl! END
BEGIN NOW That's what they enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW Taking a man END
BEGIN NOW from another woman. END
BEGIN NOW Or even hear of it. END
BEGIN NOW Different with me. END
BEGIN NOW Glad to get END
BEGIN NOW away from other chap's wife. END
BEGIN NOW Eating off his cold plate. END
BEGIN NOW Chap in the END
BEGIN NOW Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. END
BEGIN NOW French letter still in my END
BEGIN NOW pocketbook. END
BEGIN NOW Cause of half the trouble. END
BEGIN NOW But might happen sometime, I END
BEGIN NOW don't think. END
BEGIN NOW Come in, all is prepared. END
BEGIN NOW I dreamt. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Worst is END
BEGIN NOW beginning. END
BEGIN NOW How they change the venue when it's not what they like. END
BEGIN NOW Ask END
BEGIN NOW you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. END
BEGIN NOW Or ask END
BEGIN NOW you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. END
BEGIN NOW Because I did. END
BEGIN NOW She too. END
BEGIN NOW Offend her. END
BEGIN NOW Then make it up. END
BEGIN NOW Pretend to want END
BEGIN NOW something awfully, then cry off for her sake. END
BEGIN NOW Flatters them. END
BEGIN NOW She must END
BEGIN NOW have been thinking of someone else all the time. END
BEGIN NOW What harm? END
BEGIN NOW Must since END
BEGIN NOW she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. END
BEGIN NOW First kiss does the trick. END
BEGIN NOW The propitious moment. END
BEGIN NOW Something inside them goes pop. END
BEGIN NOW Mushy like, tell END
BEGIN NOW by their eye, on the sly. END
BEGIN NOW First thoughts are best. END
BEGIN NOW Remember that till END
BEGIN NOW their dying day. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the END
BEGIN NOW Moorish wall beside the gardens. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen she told me. END
BEGIN NOW But her breasts END
BEGIN NOW were developed. END
BEGIN NOW Fell asleep then. END
BEGIN NOW After Glencree dinner that was when we END
BEGIN NOW drove home. END
BEGIN NOW Featherbed mountain. END
BEGIN NOW Gnashing her teeth in sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Lord mayor END
BEGIN NOW had his eye on her too. END
BEGIN NOW Val Dillon. END
BEGIN NOW Apoplectic. END
BEGIN NOW There she is with them down there for the fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW My fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW Up END
BEGIN NOW like a rocket, down like a stick. END
BEGIN NOW And the children, twins they must be, END
BEGIN NOW waiting for something to happen. END
BEGIN NOW Want to be grownups. END
BEGIN NOW Dressing in END
BEGIN NOW mother's clothes. END
BEGIN NOW Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I knew she could END
BEGIN NOW whistle. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth made for that. END
BEGIN NOW Like Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Why that highclass whore in END
BEGIN NOW Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. END
BEGIN NOW Would you mind, please, telling END
BEGIN NOW me the right time? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. END
BEGIN NOW Say END
BEGIN NOW prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. END
BEGIN NOW Caressing the little boy too. END
BEGIN NOW Onlookers see most of the game. END
BEGIN NOW Of course END
BEGIN NOW they understand birds, animals, babies. END
BEGIN NOW In their line. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't look back when she was going down the strand. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't give that END
BEGIN NOW satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. END
BEGIN NOW Fine END
BEGIN NOW eyes she had, clear. END
BEGIN NOW It's the white of the eye brings that out not so END
BEGIN NOW much the pupil. END
BEGIN NOW Did she know what I? END
BEGIN NOW Course. END
BEGIN NOW Like a cat sitting beyond a END
BEGIN NOW dog's jump. END
BEGIN NOW Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school END
BEGIN NOW drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. END
BEGIN NOW Call that END
BEGIN NOW innocence? END
BEGIN NOW Poor idiot! END
BEGIN NOW His wife has her work cut out for her. END
BEGIN NOW Never see END
BEGIN NOW them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes all over them. END
BEGIN NOW Look under the END
BEGIN NOW bed for what's not there. END
BEGIN NOW Longing to get the fright of their lives. END
BEGIN NOW Sharp as needles they are. END
BEGIN NOW When I said to Molly the man at the corner of END
BEGIN NOW Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he END
BEGIN NOW had a false arm. END
BEGIN NOW Had, too. END
BEGIN NOW Where do they get that? END
BEGIN NOW Typist going up Roger END
BEGIN NOW Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. END
BEGIN NOW Handed down END
BEGIN NOW from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Bred in the bone. END
BEGIN NOW Milly for END
BEGIN NOW example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. END
BEGIN NOW Best END
BEGIN NOW place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. END
BEGIN NOW And when I sent her END
BEGIN NOW for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must, END
BEGIN NOW carrying home the change in her stocking! END
BEGIN NOW Clever little minx. END
BEGIN NOW I never END
BEGIN NOW told her. END
BEGIN NOW Neat way she carries parcels too. END
BEGIN NOW Attract men, small thing END
BEGIN NOW like that. END
BEGIN NOW Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back END
BEGIN NOW when it was red. END
BEGIN NOW Who did you learn that from? END
BEGIN NOW Nobody. END
BEGIN NOW Something the END
BEGIN NOW nurse taught me. END
BEGIN NOW O, don't they know! END
BEGIN NOW Three years old she was in front of END
BEGIN NOW Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. END
BEGIN NOW Me have END
BEGIN NOW a nice pace. END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW Ways of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Young student. END
BEGIN NOW Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. END
BEGIN NOW Still she was game. END
BEGIN NOW Lord, I am wet. END
BEGIN NOW Devil you are. END
BEGIN NOW Swell of her calf. END
BEGIN NOW Transparent stockings, END
BEGIN NOW stretched to breaking point. END
BEGIN NOW Not like that frump today. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW Rumpled END
BEGIN NOW stockings. END
BEGIN NOW Or the one in Grafton street. END
BEGIN NOW White. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! END
BEGIN NOW Beef to the heel. END
BEGIN NOW A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. END
BEGIN NOW Zrads and END
BEGIN NOW zrads, zrads, zrads. END
BEGIN NOW And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and END
BEGIN NOW Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW Will she? END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW Watch! END
BEGIN NOW See! END
BEGIN NOW Looked round. END
BEGIN NOW She smelt an onion. END
BEGIN NOW Darling, END
BEGIN NOW I saw, your. END
BEGIN NOW I saw all. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Did me good all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. END
BEGIN NOW For this END
BEGIN NOW relief much thanks. END
BEGIN NOW In Hamlet, that is. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW It was all things END
BEGIN NOW combined. END
BEGIN NOW Excitement. END
BEGIN NOW When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of END
BEGIN NOW my tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Your head it simply swirls. END
BEGIN NOW He's right. END
BEGIN NOW Might have made a END
BEGIN NOW worse fool of myself however. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of talking about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Then I END
BEGIN NOW will tell you all. END
BEGIN NOW Still it was a kind of language between us. END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW couldn't be? END
BEGIN NOW No, Gerty they called her. END
BEGIN NOW Might be false name however like END
BEGIN NOW my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind. END
BEGIN NOW Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in END
BEGIN NOW Irishtown. END
BEGIN NOW Place made me think of that I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW All tarred with the same brush END
BEGIN NOW Wiping pens in their stockings. END
BEGIN NOW But the ball rolled down to her as if it END
BEGIN NOW understood. END
BEGIN NOW Every bullet has its billet. END
BEGIN NOW Course I never could throw END
BEGIN NOW anything straight at school. END
BEGIN NOW Crooked as a ram's horn. END
BEGIN NOW Sad however END
BEGIN NOW because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping END
BEGIN NOW and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby END
BEGIN NOW when they hold him out to do ah ah. END
BEGIN NOW No soft job. END
BEGIN NOW Saves them. END
BEGIN NOW Keeps them END
BEGIN NOW out of harm's way. END
BEGIN NOW Nature. END
BEGIN NOW Washing child, washing corpse. END
BEGIN NOW Dignam. END
BEGIN NOW Children's hands always round them. END
BEGIN NOW Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even END
BEGIN NOW closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. END
BEGIN NOW Oughtn't END
BEGIN NOW to have given that child an empty teat to suck. END
BEGIN NOW Fill it up with wind. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. END
BEGIN NOW Must call to the hospital. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is nurse Callan END
BEGIN NOW there still. END
BEGIN NOW She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the END
BEGIN NOW Coffee Palace. END
BEGIN NOW That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. END
BEGIN NOW And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. END
BEGIN NOW Worst of END
BEGIN NOW all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. END
BEGIN NOW Husband rolling in END
BEGIN NOW drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. END
BEGIN NOW Have that in your nose in END
BEGIN NOW the dark, whiff of stale boose. END
BEGIN NOW Then ask in the morning: was I drunk END
BEGIN NOW last night? END
BEGIN NOW Bad policy however to fault the husband. END
BEGIN NOW Chickens come home END
BEGIN NOW to roost. END
BEGIN NOW They stick by one another like glue. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the women's fault END
BEGIN NOW also. END
BEGIN NOW That's where Molly can knock spots off them. END
BEGIN NOW It's the blood of the END
BEGIN NOW south. END
BEGIN NOW Moorish. END
BEGIN NOW Also the form, the figure. END
BEGIN NOW Hands felt for the opulent. END
BEGIN NOW Just compare for instance those others. END
BEGIN NOW Wife locked up at home, skeleton END
BEGIN NOW in the cupboard. END
BEGIN NOW Allow me to introduce my. END
BEGIN NOW Then they trot you out some END
BEGIN NOW kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. END
BEGIN NOW Always see a END
BEGIN NOW fellow's weak point in his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Still there's destiny in it, falling in END
BEGIN NOW love. END
BEGIN NOW Have their own secrets between them. END
BEGIN NOW Chaps that would go to the END
BEGIN NOW dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. END
BEGIN NOW Then little chits of girls, END
BEGIN NOW height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. END
BEGIN NOW As God made them END
BEGIN NOW he matched them. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes children turn out well enough. END
BEGIN NOW Twice nought END
BEGIN NOW makes one. END
BEGIN NOW Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. END
BEGIN NOW Marry in May END
BEGIN NOW and repent in December. END
BEGIN NOW This wet is very unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Stuck. END
BEGIN NOW Well the END
BEGIN NOW foreskin is not back. END
BEGIN NOW Better detach. END
BEGIN NOW Ow! END
BEGIN NOW Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. END
BEGIN NOW Long and the END
BEGIN NOW short of it. END
BEGIN NOW Big he and little she. END
BEGIN NOW Very strange about my watch. END
BEGIN NOW Wristwatches are always going wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder is there any magnetic END
BEGIN NOW influence between the person because that was about the time he. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I END
BEGIN NOW suppose, at once. END
BEGIN NOW Cat's away, the mice will play. END
BEGIN NOW I remember looking in END
BEGIN NOW Pill lane. END
BEGIN NOW Also that now is magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Back of everything magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. END
BEGIN NOW That causes movement. END
BEGIN NOW And time, well that's the time the movement takes. END
BEGIN NOW Then if one thing END
BEGIN NOW stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. END
BEGIN NOW Because it's all END
BEGIN NOW arranged. END
BEGIN NOW Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the END
BEGIN NOW stars. END
BEGIN NOW Little piece of steel iron. END
BEGIN NOW When you hold out the fork. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW Tip. END
BEGIN NOW Woman and man that is. END
BEGIN NOW Fork and steel. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, he. END
BEGIN NOW Dress up END
BEGIN NOW and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're END
BEGIN NOW a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you END
BEGIN NOW have any guts in you. END
BEGIN NOW Tip. END
BEGIN NOW Have to let fly. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how is she feeling in that region. END
BEGIN NOW Shame all put on before third END
BEGIN NOW person. END
BEGIN NOW More put out about a hole in her stocking. END
BEGIN NOW Molly, her underjaw END
BEGIN NOW stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at END
BEGIN NOW the horse show. END
BEGIN NOW And when the painters were in Lombard street west. END
BEGIN NOW Fine END
BEGIN NOW voice that fellow had. END
BEGIN NOW How Giuglini began. END
BEGIN NOW Smell that I did. END
BEGIN NOW Like END
BEGIN NOW flowers. END
BEGIN NOW It was too. END
BEGIN NOW Violets. END
BEGIN NOW Came from the turpentine probably in the END
BEGIN NOW paint. END
BEGIN NOW Make their own use of everything. END
BEGIN NOW Same time doing it scraped her END
BEGIN NOW slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. END
BEGIN NOW But lots of them can't kick END
BEGIN NOW the beam, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Keep that thing up for hours. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a general all END
BEGIN NOW round over me and half down my back. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW That's her perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Why she waved her hand. END
BEGIN NOW I leave END
BEGIN NOW you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Heliotrope? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Hyacinth? END
BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Roses, I think. END
BEGIN NOW She'd like scent of that END
BEGIN NOW kind. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet and cheap: soon sour. END
BEGIN NOW Why Molly likes opoponax. END

BEGIN NOW She END

BEGIN NOW Why did I smell it only now? END
BEGIN NOW Took its time in coming like herself, END
BEGIN NOW slow but sure. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown END

BEGIN NOW Yes, it is. END
BEGIN NOW Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this END
BEGIN NOW morning, smell them leagues off. END
BEGIN NOW Tell you what it is. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a fine END
BEGIN NOW fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call END

BEGIN NOW Hm. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, thank you. END

BEGIN NOW Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. END
BEGIN NOW Like END
BEGIN NOW what? END

BEGIN NOW Very END

BEGIN NOW Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. END
BEGIN NOW Ba. END
BEGIN NOW Again. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder why they come out END
BEGIN NOW at night like mice. END
BEGIN NOW They're a mixed breed. END
BEGIN NOW Birds are like hopping mice. END
BEGIN NOW What frightens them, light or noise? END
BEGIN NOW Better sit still. END
BEGIN NOW All instinct like END

BEGIN NOW Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. END
BEGIN NOW Weeny END

BEGIN NOW Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. END
BEGIN NOW Colours depend END

BEGIN NOW Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look END

BEGIN NOW Wants to stamp his trademark on END

BEGIN NOW Then the heather goes on fire. END
BEGIN NOW It can't be tourists' END

BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and END

BEGIN NOW Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Archimedes. END
BEGIN NOW I have it! END
BEGIN NOW My memory's not so bad. END
BEGIN NOW Ba. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows what they're always flying for. END
BEGIN NOW Insects? END
BEGIN NOW That bee last END

BEGIN NOW Might be END
BEGIN NOW the one bit me, come back to see. END
BEGIN NOW Birds too. END
BEGIN NOW Never find out. END
BEGIN NOW Or what END
BEGIN NOW they say. END
BEGIN NOW Like our small talk. END
BEGIN NOW And says she and says he. END
BEGIN NOW Nerve they have END
BEGIN NOW to fly over the ocean and back. END
BEGIN NOW Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph END

BEGIN NOW Dreadful life sailors have too. END
BEGIN NOW Big brutes of oceangoing steamers END
BEGIN NOW floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. END
BEGIN NOW Faugh a Ballagh! END
BEGIN NOW Out of that, bloody curse to you! END
BEGIN NOW Others in vessels, bit of a END

BEGIN NOW How can END

BEGIN NOW Yet they do. END
BEGIN NOW The anchor's weighed. END
BEGIN NOW Off he sails with END
BEGIN NOW a scapular or a medal on him for luck. END
BEGIN NOW Well. END
BEGIN NOW And the tephilim no what's END
BEGIN NOW this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. END
BEGIN NOW Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know END
BEGIN NOW what dangers. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, END
BEGIN NOW lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs END
BEGIN NOW till the sharks catch hold of him. END
BEGIN NOW Do fish ever get seasick? END
BEGIN NOW Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew END
BEGIN NOW and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so END
BEGIN NOW peaceful. END
BEGIN NOW Not my fault, old cockalorum. END
BEGIN NOW A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of END
BEGIN NOW funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of END
BEGIN NOW violet but one white stars. END
BEGIN NOW They floated, fell: they faded. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. END
BEGIN NOW From house to END
BEGIN NOW house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock END
BEGIN NOW postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through END
BEGIN NOW the laurel hedges. END
BEGIN NOW And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock END
BEGIN NOW lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. END
BEGIN NOW By screens of lighted windows, by equal END
BEGIN NOW gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop END
BEGIN NOW press edition! END
BEGIN NOW Result of the Gold Cup race! END
BEGIN NOW and from the door of END
BEGIN NOW Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. END
BEGIN NOW Twittering the bat flew here, END
BEGIN NOW flew there. END
BEGIN NOW Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. END
BEGIN NOW Howth END
BEGIN NOW settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was END
BEGIN NOW old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, END
BEGIN NOW slumberous but awake. END
BEGIN NOW And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship END
BEGIN NOW twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. END
BEGIN NOW Irish END
BEGIN NOW Lights board. END
BEGIN NOW Penance for their sins. END
BEGIN NOW Coastguards too. END
BEGIN NOW Rocket and END
BEGIN NOW breeches buoy and lifeboat. END
BEGIN NOW Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in END
BEGIN NOW the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. END
BEGIN NOW Bears in the zoo. END
BEGIN NOW Filthy trip. END
BEGIN NOW Drunkards out to shake up their livers. END
BEGIN NOW Puking overboard to END
BEGIN NOW feed the herrings. END
BEGIN NOW Nausea. END
BEGIN NOW And the women, fear of God in their faces. END
BEGIN NOW Milly, no sign of funk. END
BEGIN NOW Her blue scarf loose, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Don't know what END
BEGIN NOW death is at that age. END
BEGIN NOW And then their stomachs clean. END
BEGIN NOW But being lost they END
BEGIN NOW fear. END
BEGIN NOW When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't want to. END
BEGIN NOW Mamma! END
BEGIN NOW Mamma! END
BEGIN NOW Babes in the wood. END
BEGIN NOW Frightening them with masks too. END
BEGIN NOW Throwing them END
BEGIN NOW up in the air to catch them. END
BEGIN NOW I'll murder you. END
BEGIN NOW Is it only half fun? END
BEGIN NOW Or END
BEGIN NOW children playing battle. END
BEGIN NOW Whole earnest. END
BEGIN NOW How can people aim guns at each END
BEGIN NOW other. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they go off. END
BEGIN NOW Poor kids! END
BEGIN NOW Only troubles wildfire and END
BEGIN NOW nettlerash. END
BEGIN NOW Calomel purge I got her for that. END
BEGIN NOW After getting better END
BEGIN NOW asleep with Molly. END
BEGIN NOW Very same teeth she has. END
BEGIN NOW What do they love? END
BEGIN NOW Another END
BEGIN NOW themselves? END
BEGIN NOW But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps so END
BEGIN NOW as not to hurt. END
BEGIN NOW I felt her pulse. END
BEGIN NOW Ticking. END
BEGIN NOW Little hand it was: now big. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Papli. END
BEGIN NOW All that the hand says when you touch. END
BEGIN NOW Loved to count my END
BEGIN NOW waistcoat buttons. END
BEGIN NOW Her first stays I remember. END
BEGIN NOW Made me laugh to see. END
BEGIN NOW Little paps to begin with. END
BEGIN NOW Left one is more sensitive, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Mine END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Nearer the heart? END
BEGIN NOW Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Her END
BEGIN NOW growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. END
BEGIN NOW Frightened she was when END
BEGIN NOW her nature came on her first. END
BEGIN NOW Poor child! END
BEGIN NOW Strange moment for the mother END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Brings back her girlhood. END
BEGIN NOW Gibraltar. END
BEGIN NOW Looking from Buena Vista. END
BEGIN NOW O'Hara's tower. END
BEGIN NOW The seabirds screaming. END
BEGIN NOW Old Barbary ape that gobbled all END
BEGIN NOW his family. END
BEGIN NOW Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. END
BEGIN NOW Looking out END
BEGIN NOW over the sea she told me. END
BEGIN NOW Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a END
BEGIN NOW private yacht. END
BEGIN NOW Buenas noches, seÃ±orita. END
BEGIN NOW El hombre ama la muchacha END
BEGIN NOW hermosa. END
BEGIN NOW Why me? END
BEGIN NOW Because you were so foreign from the others. END
BEGIN NOW Better not stick here all night like a limpet. END
BEGIN NOW This weather makes you END
BEGIN NOW dull. END
BEGIN NOW Must be getting on for nine by the light. END
BEGIN NOW Go home. END
BEGIN NOW Too late for END
BEGIN NOW Leah, Lily of Killarney. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Might be still up. END
BEGIN NOW Call to the hospital to END
BEGIN NOW see. END
BEGIN NOW Hope she's over. END
BEGIN NOW Long day I've had. END
BEGIN NOW Martha, the bath, funeral, END
BEGIN NOW house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. END
BEGIN NOW Then that END
BEGIN NOW bawler in Barney Kiernan's. END
BEGIN NOW Got my own back there. END
BEGIN NOW Drunken ranters what END
BEGIN NOW I said about his God made him wince. END
BEGIN NOW Mistake to hit back. END
BEGIN NOW Or? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Ought END
BEGIN NOW to go home and laugh at themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Always want to be swilling in END
BEGIN NOW company. END
BEGIN NOW Afraid to be alone like a child of two. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he hit me. END
BEGIN NOW Look END
BEGIN NOW at it other way round. END
BEGIN NOW Not so bad then. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps not to hurt he meant. END
BEGIN NOW Three cheers for Israel. END
BEGIN NOW Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked END
BEGIN NOW about, three fangs in her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Same style of beauty. END
BEGIN NOW Particularly nice END
BEGIN NOW old party for a cup of tea. END
BEGIN NOW The sister of the wife of the wild man of END
BEGIN NOW Borneo has just come to town. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine that in the early morning at close END
BEGIN NOW range. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW Dignam's put the boots on it. END
BEGIN NOW Houses of mourning so depressing because END
BEGIN NOW you never know. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow she wants the money. END
BEGIN NOW Must call to those Scottish END
BEGIN NOW Widows as I promised. END
BEGIN NOW Strange name. END
BEGIN NOW Takes it for granted we're going to END
BEGIN NOW pop off first. END
BEGIN NOW That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that looked END
BEGIN NOW at me. END
BEGIN NOW Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the END
BEGIN NOW premium. END
BEGIN NOW Her widow's mite. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What do you expect her to do? END
BEGIN NOW Must END
BEGIN NOW wheedle her way along. END
BEGIN NOW Widower I hate to see. END
BEGIN NOW Looks so forlorn. END
BEGIN NOW Poor man END
BEGIN NOW O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. END
BEGIN NOW The sewage. END
BEGIN NOW Hopeless. END
BEGIN NOW Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. END
BEGIN NOW Take END
BEGIN NOW him in tow, platter face and a large apron. END
BEGIN NOW Ladies' grey flannelette END
BEGIN NOW bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. END
BEGIN NOW Plain and loved, END
BEGIN NOW loved for ever, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Ugly: no woman thinks she is. END
BEGIN NOW Love, lie and be END
BEGIN NOW handsome for tomorrow we die. END
BEGIN NOW See him sometimes walking about trying to END
BEGIN NOW find out who played the trick. END
BEGIN NOW U. END
BEGIN NOW p: up. END
BEGIN NOW Fate that is. END
BEGIN NOW He, not me. END
BEGIN NOW Also END
BEGIN NOW a shop often noticed. END
BEGIN NOW Curse seems to dog it. END
BEGIN NOW Dreamt last night? END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW Something confused. END
BEGIN NOW She had red slippers on. END
BEGIN NOW Turkish. END
BEGIN NOW Wore the breeches. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose she does? END
BEGIN NOW Would I like her in pyjamas? END
BEGIN NOW Damned hard to answer. END
BEGIN NOW Nannetti's gone. END
BEGIN NOW Mailboat. END
BEGIN NOW Near Holyhead by now. END
BEGIN NOW Must nail that ad of END
BEGIN NOW Keyes's. END
BEGIN NOW Work Hynes and Crawford. END
BEGIN NOW Petticoats for Molly. END
BEGIN NOW She has END
BEGIN NOW something to put in them. END
BEGIN NOW What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Might be money. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW brought it near his eyes and peered. END
BEGIN NOW Letter? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Can't read. END
BEGIN NOW Better go. END
BEGIN NOW Better. END
BEGIN NOW I'm tired to move. END
BEGIN NOW Page of an old copybook. END
BEGIN NOW All those holes and END
BEGIN NOW pebbles. END
BEGIN NOW Who could count them? END
BEGIN NOW Never know what you find. END
BEGIN NOW Bottle with END
BEGIN NOW story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. END
BEGIN NOW Parcels post. END
BEGIN NOW Children END
BEGIN NOW always want to throw things in the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Trust? END
BEGIN NOW Bread cast on the waters. END
BEGIN NOW What's this? END
BEGIN NOW Bit of stick. END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW Exhausted that female has me. END
BEGIN NOW Not so young now. END
BEGIN NOW Will she come here END
BEGIN NOW tomorrow? END
BEGIN NOW Wait for her somewhere for ever. END
BEGIN NOW Must come back. END
BEGIN NOW Murderers do. END
BEGIN NOW Will I? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. END
BEGIN NOW Write a END
BEGIN NOW message for her. END
BEGIN NOW Might remain. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW I. END
BEGIN NOW Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Useless. END
BEGIN NOW Washed away. END
BEGIN NOW Tide END
BEGIN NOW comes here. END
BEGIN NOW Saw a pool near her foot. END
BEGIN NOW Bend, see my face there, dark END
BEGIN NOW mirror, breathe on it, stirs. END
BEGIN NOW All these rocks with lines and scars and END
BEGIN NOW letters. END
BEGIN NOW O, those transparent! END
BEGIN NOW Besides they don't know. END
BEGIN NOW What is the END
BEGIN NOW meaning of that other world. END
BEGIN NOW I called you naughty boy because I do not END
BEGIN NOW like. END
BEGIN NOW AM. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW No room. END
BEGIN NOW Let it go. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. END
BEGIN NOW Hopeless thing sand. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing grows in it. END

BEGIN NOW Sad was the man that word to hear that him so END

BEGIN NOW All she there told him, ruing death for END

BEGIN NOW He heard her END
BEGIN NOW sad words, in held hat sad staring. END

BEGIN NOW Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the END

BEGIN NOW The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and END
BEGIN NOW he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now END
BEGIN NOW full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but END
BEGIN NOW that now in a little it would be. END
BEGIN NOW She said thereto that she had seen END
BEGIN NOW many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman's END
BEGIN NOW birth. END
BEGIN NOW Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man END
BEGIN NOW that time was had lived nigh that house. END
BEGIN NOW The man hearkened to her words END
BEGIN NOW for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they have of END
BEGIN NOW motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for END
BEGIN NOW any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. END
BEGIN NOW Nine END
BEGIN NOW twelve bloodflows chiding her childless. END
BEGIN NOW And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed END
BEGIN NOW them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. END
BEGIN NOW And there came END
BEGIN NOW against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they END
BEGIN NOW had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this END
BEGIN NOW learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be END
BEGIN NOW healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a END
BEGIN NOW horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a END
BEGIN NOW salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. END
BEGIN NOW And he END
BEGIN NOW said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them END
BEGIN NOW that were there. END
BEGIN NOW And the traveller Leopold said that he should go END
BEGIN NOW otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. END
BEGIN NOW Also the lady END
BEGIN NOW was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well END
BEGIN NOW that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have END
BEGIN NOW him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous END
BEGIN NOW castle. END
BEGIN NOW And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him END
BEGIN NOW for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers END
BEGIN NOW lands and sometime venery. END
BEGIN NOW And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy END
BEGIN NOW and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not END
BEGIN NOW move more for enchantment. END
BEGIN NOW And on this board were frightful swords and END
BEGIN NOW knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white END
BEGIN NOW flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there END
BEGIN NOW abound marvellously. END
BEGIN NOW And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of END
BEGIN NOW Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he END
BEGIN NOW blases in to them like to bubbles. END
BEGIN NOW And full fair cheer and rich was on END
BEGIN NOW the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. END
BEGIN NOW And there was a END
BEGIN NOW vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange END
BEGIN NOW fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible END
BEGIN NOW thing without they see it natheless they are so. END
BEGIN NOW And these fishes lie in END
BEGIN NOW an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness END
BEGIN NOW that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. END
BEGIN NOW And also it was a END
BEGIN NOW marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of END
BEGIN NOW fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits END
BEGIN NOW that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks END
BEGIN NOW out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a END
BEGIN NOW brewage like to mead. END
BEGIN NOW And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp END
BEGIN NOW thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. END
BEGIN NOW And childe END
BEGIN NOW Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat END
BEGIN NOW in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and END
BEGIN NOW anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his END
BEGIN NOW neighbour nist not of this wile. END
BEGIN NOW And he sat down in that castle with END
BEGIN NOW them for to rest him there awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Thanked be Almighty God. END
BEGIN NOW This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the END
BEGIN NOW reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for END
BEGIN NOW there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied END
BEGIN NOW fast. END
BEGIN NOW Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what END
BEGIN NOW cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it END
BEGIN NOW be not come or now. END
BEGIN NOW Meseems it dureth overlong. END
BEGIN NOW And he was ware and saw END
BEGIN NOW a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than END
BEGIN NOW any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the END
BEGIN NOW one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full END
BEGIN NOW gently. END
BEGIN NOW But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His END
BEGIN NOW bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. END
BEGIN NOW And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her END
BEGIN NOW next. END
BEGIN NOW Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never END
BEGIN NOW none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully END
BEGIN NOW delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both's health for END
BEGIN NOW he was a passing good man of his lustiness. END
BEGIN NOW And sir Leopold that was the END
BEGIN NOW goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars' hall and that was the meekest END
BEGIN NOW man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was END
BEGIN NOW the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to END
BEGIN NOW lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. END
BEGIN NOW Woman's woe with wonder END
BEGIN NOW pondering. END
BEGIN NOW Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be END
BEGIN NOW drunken an they might. END
BEGIN NOW There was a sort of scholars along either side END
BEGIN NOW the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable's END
BEGIN NOW with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the END
BEGIN NOW franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and END
BEGIN NOW young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and END
BEGIN NOW Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him END
BEGIN NOW erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the END
BEGIN NOW most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir END
BEGIN NOW Leopold. END
BEGIN NOW But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have END
BEGIN NOW come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. END
BEGIN NOW And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon END
BEGIN NOW and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him END
BEGIN NOW there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that END
BEGIN NOW time in the honourablest manner. END
BEGIN NOW Ruth red him, love led on with will to END
BEGIN NOW wander, loth to leave. END
BEGIN NOW For they were right witty scholars. END
BEGIN NOW And he heard their aresouns each gen END
BEGIN NOW other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that END
BEGIN NOW put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a END
BEGIN NOW matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house that END
BEGIN NOW now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her END
BEGIN NOW death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, END
BEGIN NOW the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of END
BEGIN NOW this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had END
BEGIN NOW conscience to let her die. END
BEGIN NOW And not few and of these was young Lynch were END
BEGIN NOW in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never END
BEGIN NOW other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his END
BEGIN NOW judges did provide no remedy. END
BEGIN NOW A redress God grant. END
BEGIN NOW This was scant said END
BEGIN NOW but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife END
BEGIN NOW should live and the babe to die. END
BEGIN NOW In colour whereof they waxed hot upon END
BEGIN NOW that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the END
BEGIN NOW franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the END
BEGIN NOW least way mirth might not lack. END
BEGIN NOW Then young Madden showed all the whole END
BEGIN NOW affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by END
BEGIN NOW rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of END
BEGIN NOW Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were END
BEGIN NOW all wondrous grieved. END
BEGIN NOW To whom young Stephen had these words following: END
BEGIN NOW Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. END
BEGIN NOW Both babe and parent now END
BEGIN NOW glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. END
BEGIN NOW But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly END
BEGIN NOW impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord END
BEGIN NOW and Giver of Life? END
BEGIN NOW For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. END
BEGIN NOW We are means END
BEGIN NOW to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. END
BEGIN NOW Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. END
BEGIN NOW But he had END
BEGIN NOW overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he END
BEGIN NOW would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if END
BEGIN NOW it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. END
BEGIN NOW Whereat END
BEGIN NOW Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that beast the END
BEGIN NOW unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all END
BEGIN NOW this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice END
BEGIN NOW him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he END
BEGIN NOW was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. END
BEGIN NOW Thereat END
BEGIN NOW laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which END
BEGIN NOW never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would END
BEGIN NOW not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might END
BEGIN NOW be or wheresoever. END
BEGIN NOW Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church END
BEGIN NOW that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, END
BEGIN NOW patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness END
BEGIN NOW or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the END
BEGIN NOW influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie END
BEGIN NOW with a woman which her man has but lain with, effectu secuto, or END
BEGIN NOW peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses END
BEGIN NOW Maimonides. END
BEGIN NOW He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul END
BEGIN NOW was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God's END
BEGIN NOW greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear END
BEGIN NOW beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman's END
BEGIN NOW seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages END
BEGIN NOW founded. END
BEGIN NOW All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like END
BEGIN NOW case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. END
BEGIN NOW A wariness of mind END
BEGIN NOW he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said END
BEGIN NOW dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever END
BEGIN NOW loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his END
BEGIN NOW experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother END
BEGIN NOW Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort END
BEGIN NOW deliverly he scaped their questions. END
BEGIN NOW That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, END
BEGIN NOW and, or I err, a pregnant word. END
BEGIN NOW Which hearing young Stephen was a END
BEGIN NOW marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor END
BEGIN NOW lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and END
BEGIN NOW that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. END
BEGIN NOW But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had END
BEGIN NOW pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and END
BEGIN NOW as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only END
BEGIN NOW manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art END
BEGIN NOW could save so dark is destiny. END
BEGIN NOW And she was wondrous stricken of heart END
BEGIN NOW for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of END
BEGIN NOW lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and END
BEGIN NOW lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now Sir END
BEGIN NOW Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his END
BEGIN NOW friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and END
BEGIN NOW as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all END
BEGIN NOW accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for END
BEGIN NOW young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and END
BEGIN NOW murdered his goods with whores. END
BEGIN NOW About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty END
BEGIN NOW so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed END
BEGIN NOW their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for END
BEGIN NOW the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the END
BEGIN NOW vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. END
BEGIN NOW Now drink we, END
BEGIN NOW quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel END
BEGIN NOW of my body but my soul's bodiment. END
BEGIN NOW Leave ye fraction of bread to them END
BEGIN NOW that live by bread alone. END
BEGIN NOW Be not afeard neither for any want for this END
BEGIN NOW will comfort more than the other will dismay. END
BEGIN NOW See ye here. END
BEGIN NOW And he showed END
BEGIN NOW them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of END
BEGIN NOW two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he END
BEGIN NOW writ. END
BEGIN NOW They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of END
BEGIN NOW money as was herebefore. END
BEGIN NOW His words were then these as followeth: Know END
BEGIN NOW all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's mansions. END
BEGIN NOW What means END
BEGIN NOW this? END
BEGIN NOW Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a END
BEGIN NOW bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. END
BEGIN NOW Mark me now. END
BEGIN NOW In woman's END
BEGIN NOW womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that END
BEGIN NOW passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. END
BEGIN NOW This is the END
BEGIN NOW postcreation. END
BEGIN NOW Omnis caro ad te veniet. END
BEGIN NOW No question but her name is END
BEGIN NOW puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, END
BEGIN NOW our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly END
BEGIN NOW that She hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem, that is to wit, an END
BEGIN NOW almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, END
BEGIN NOW saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are END
BEGIN NOW linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, END
BEGIN NOW seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. END
BEGIN NOW But here is the matter END
BEGIN NOW now. END
BEGIN NOW Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her END
BEGIN NOW creature, vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio, or she knew him not and END
BEGIN NOW then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who END
BEGIN NOW lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of END
BEGIN NOW the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, parceque M. END
BEGIN NOW LÃ©o Taxil nous a END
BEGIN NOW dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette fichue position c'Ã©tait le sacre END
BEGIN NOW pigeon, ventre de Dieu! END
BEGIN NOW Entweder transubstantiality ODER END
BEGIN NOW consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. END
BEGIN NOW And all cried out END
BEGIN NOW upon it for a very scurvy word. END
BEGIN NOW A pregnancy without joy, he said, a END
BEGIN NOW birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness. END
BEGIN NOW Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. END
BEGIN NOW With will will we END
BEGIN NOW withstand, withsay. END
BEGIN NOW Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would END
BEGIN NOW sing a bawdy catch Staboo Stabella about a wench that was put in pod of END
BEGIN NOW a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: The END
BEGIN NOW first three months she was not well, Staboo, when here nurse Quigley END
BEGIN NOW from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not END

BEGIN NOW it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and END

BEGIN NOW But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? END
BEGIN NOW No, for he END

BEGIN NOW And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the END

BEGIN NOW He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the END
BEGIN NOW bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? END
BEGIN NOW Indeed no for Grace was not END
BEGIN NOW there to find that bottle. END
BEGIN NOW Heard he then in that clap the voice of the END
BEGIN NOW god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? END
BEGIN NOW Heard? END
BEGIN NOW Why, END
BEGIN NOW he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube END
BEGIN NOW Understanding (which he had not done). END
BEGIN NOW For through that tube he saw that END
BEGIN NOW he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die END
BEGIN NOW as he was like the rest too a passing show. END
BEGIN NOW And would he not accept to END
BEGIN NOW die like the rest and pass away? END
BEGIN NOW By no means would he though he must nor END
BEGIN NOW would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon END
BEGIN NOW has commanded them to do by the book Law. END
BEGIN NOW Then wotted he nought of that END
BEGIN NOW other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise END
BEGIN NOW which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there END
BEGIN NOW is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall END
BEGIN NOW come as many as believe on it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Pious had told him of that land and END
BEGIN NOW Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he END
BEGIN NOW fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she END
BEGIN NOW said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true END
BEGIN NOW path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn END
BEGIN NOW aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so END
BEGIN NOW flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush END
BEGIN NOW or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence. END
BEGIN NOW This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of END
BEGIN NOW Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in- END
BEGIN NOW the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked END

BEGIN NOW her. END
BEGIN NOW For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion END
BEGIN NOW and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush END
BEGIN NOW whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four END
BEGIN NOW pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, END
BEGIN NOW Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, END
BEGIN NOW for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for END

BEGIN NOW Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for END
BEGIN NOW that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he END

BEGIN NOW In sum END
BEGIN NOW an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase END
BEGIN NOW the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come END
BEGIN NOW for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell END

BEGIN NOW fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes END
BEGIN NOW they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how. END
BEGIN NOW With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter END
BEGIN NOW was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for END
BEGIN NOW he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near END
BEGIN NOW by which he did mighty brisk. END
BEGIN NOW He was a kind of sport gentleman that went END
BEGIN NOW for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, END
BEGIN NOW horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. END
BEGIN NOW To tell the truth he was mean END
BEGIN NOW in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and END
BEGIN NOW low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, END
BEGIN NOW flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the END
BEGIN NOW game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till END
BEGIN NOW broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose END
BEGIN NOW gossip. END
BEGIN NOW He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten END
BEGIN NOW into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare END
BEGIN NOW tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, END
BEGIN NOW some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of END
BEGIN NOW them would burst their sides. END
BEGIN NOW The other, Costello that is, hearing this END
BEGIN NOW talk asked was it poetry or a tale. END
BEGIN NOW Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was END
BEGIN NOW his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of END
BEGIN NOW the plague. END
BEGIN NOW But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their END
BEGIN NOW bully beef, a pox on it. END
BEGIN NOW There's as good fish in this tin as ever came END
BEGIN NOW out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that END
BEGIN NOW stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place END
BEGIN NOW which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. END
BEGIN NOW Mort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been END
BEGIN NOW indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he END
BEGIN NOW spoke French like a gentleman too. END
BEGIN NOW From a child this Frank had been a END
BEGIN NOW donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to END
BEGIN NOW school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at END
BEGIN NOW the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his END
BEGIN NOW teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the END
BEGIN NOW parish beadle than with his volumes. END
BEGIN NOW One time he would be a playactor, END
BEGIN NOW then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit END
BEGIN NOW and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the END
BEGIN NOW roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of END
BEGIN NOW moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked END
BEGIN NOW pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of END
BEGIN NOW tears as often as he saw him. END
BEGIN NOW What, says Mr Leopold with his hands END
BEGIN NOW across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter END
BEGIN NOW all? END
BEGIN NOW I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool END
BEGIN NOW boats, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. END
BEGIN NOW And he had END
BEGIN NOW experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and END
BEGIN NOW wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, END
BEGIN NOW a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow END
BEGIN NOW auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. END
BEGIN NOW I question with END
BEGIN NOW you there, says he. END
BEGIN NOW More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Mr END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and END
BEGIN NOW that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him END
BEGIN NOW for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the END
BEGIN NOW bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to END
BEGIN NOW take the bull by the horns. END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. END
BEGIN NOW He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull END
BEGIN NOW that's Irish, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English END
BEGIN NOW chinashop. END
BEGIN NOW I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW It is that same bull that was END
BEGIN NOW sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them END
BEGIN NOW all, with an emerald ring in his nose. END
BEGIN NOW True for you, says Mr Vincent END
BEGIN NOW cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper END
BEGIN NOW and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. END
BEGIN NOW He had horns END
BEGIN NOW galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of END
BEGIN NOW his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and END
BEGIN NOW rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. END
BEGIN NOW What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas END
BEGIN NOW that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who END
BEGIN NOW were no better off than himself. END
BEGIN NOW So be off now, says he, and do all my END
BEGIN NOW cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and END
BEGIN NOW with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. END
BEGIN NOW But the slap and the END
BEGIN NOW blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him END
BEGIN NOW a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to END
BEGIN NOW this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in END
BEGIN NOW his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his END
BEGIN NOW long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in END
BEGIN NOW the four fields of all Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Another then put in his word: And they END
BEGIN NOW dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and END
BEGIN NOW girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him END
BEGIN NOW all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of END
BEGIN NOW the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market END
BEGIN NOW so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. END
BEGIN NOW By this time the END
BEGIN NOW father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that END
BEGIN NOW he could scarce walk to pasture. END
BEGIN NOW To remedy which our cozening dames and END
BEGIN NOW damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his END
BEGIN NOW belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their END
BEGIN NOW ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language END
BEGIN NOW and they all after him. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he END
BEGIN NOW would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself END
BEGIN NOW (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up END
BEGIN NOW on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: END
BEGIN NOW By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW And, END
BEGIN NOW says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or END
BEGIN NOW the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much END
BEGIN NOW as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half END
BEGIN NOW the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all END
BEGIN NOW by lord Harry's orders. END
BEGIN NOW There was bad blood between them at first, says END
BEGIN NOW Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks END
BEGIN NOW in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house END
BEGIN NOW and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. END
BEGIN NOW I'll make that animal smell END
BEGIN NOW hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal END
BEGIN NOW pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for END
BEGIN NOW himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row END
BEGIN NOW with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull END
BEGIN NOW and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he END
BEGIN NOW found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous END
BEGIN NOW champion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss END
BEGIN NOW of the show. END
BEGIN NOW After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head END
BEGIN NOW into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and END
BEGIN NOW pulling it out again told them all his new name. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with the water END
BEGIN NOW running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to END
BEGIN NOW his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but END
BEGIN NOW he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun END
BEGIN NOW which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for END
BEGIN NOW a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his END
BEGIN NOW fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a END
BEGIN NOW corkfloat. END
BEGIN NOW In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast END
BEGIN NOW friends as an arse and a shirt. END
BEGIN NOW They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end END
BEGIN NOW was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate END
BEGIN NOW women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and END
BEGIN NOW their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the END
BEGIN NOW yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, END
BEGIN NOW put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, END
BEGIN NOW ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, END
BEGIN NOW pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of END
BEGIN NOW America. END
BEGIN NOW Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a END
BEGIN NOW boatswain of that rollicking chanty: END
BEGIN NOW —Pope Peter's but a pissabed. END
BEGIN NOW A man's a man for a' that. END
BEGIN NOW Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway END
BEGIN NOW as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend END
BEGIN NOW whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, END
BEGIN NOW who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a END
BEGIN NOW cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan was civil END
BEGIN NOW enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a END
BEGIN NOW project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched END
BEGIN NOW on. END
BEGIN NOW Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards END
BEGIN NOW which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend END
BEGIN NOW printed in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Fertiliser and Incubator. END
BEGIN NOW Lambay Island. END
BEGIN NOW His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw END
BEGIN NOW from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir END
BEGIN NOW Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself END
BEGIN NOW to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. END
BEGIN NOW Well, END
BEGIN NOW let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. END
BEGIN NOW I make no doubt it END
BEGIN NOW smacks of wenching. END
BEGIN NOW Come, be seated, both. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis as cheap sitting as END
BEGIN NOW standing. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon END
BEGIN NOW his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a END
BEGIN NOW consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the END
BEGIN NOW prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal END
BEGIN NOW vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the END
BEGIN NOW prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities END
BEGIN NOW acquired. END
BEGIN NOW It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch END
BEGIN NOW defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable END
BEGIN NOW females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their END
BEGIN NOW flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly END
BEGIN NOW bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might END

BEGIN NOW To curb this inconvenient (which he END

BEGIN NOW resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay END
BEGIN NOW island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of END
BEGIN NOW note much in favour with our ascendancy party. END
BEGIN NOW He proposed to set up END
BEGIN NOW there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk END
BEGIN NOW hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful END
BEGIN NOW yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life END
BEGIN NOW soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the END

BEGIN NOW broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum END

BEGIN NOW After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of END
BEGIN NOW asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with END
BEGIN NOW which he had shielded it. END
BEGIN NOW They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the END
BEGIN NOW rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be END
BEGIN NOW observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now END
BEGIN NOW somewhat piebald. END
BEGIN NOW His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained END
BEGIN NOW by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of END
BEGIN NOW Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also END
BEGIN NOW to carry coals to Newcastle. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan however made court to the END

BEGIN NOW he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable END
BEGIN NOW to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard END
BEGIN NOW drake and duck. END
BEGIN NOW Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper END
BEGIN NOW man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with END
BEGIN NOW animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics END
BEGIN NOW while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had END

BEGIN NOW The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a END
BEGIN NOW passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his END
BEGIN NOW nearest neighbour. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom END
BEGIN NOW were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a END
BEGIN NOW civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional END
BEGIN NOW assistance we could give? END
BEGIN NOW Who, upon his offer, thanked him very END
BEGIN NOW heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was END
BEGIN NOW come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was in an END
BEGIN NOW interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he fetched END
BEGIN NOW a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Dixon, to END
BEGIN NOW turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his END
BEGIN NOW incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an END
BEGIN NOW ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, END
BEGIN NOW as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. END
BEGIN NOW For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote END
BEGIN NOW himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll END
BEGIN NOW mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though END
BEGIN NOW 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a bastard. END
BEGIN NOW This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw END
BEGIN NOW the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. END
BEGIN NOW The spry END
BEGIN NOW rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the END
BEGIN NOW antechamber. END
BEGIN NOW Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little END
BEGIN NOW fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion END
BEGIN NOW with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient END
BEGIN NOW point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the END
BEGIN NOW obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by END
BEGIN NOW a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had END
BEGIN NOW not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but END
BEGIN NOW contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever END
BEGIN NOW done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. END
BEGIN NOW Mais bien sÃ»r, END
BEGIN NOW noble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. END
BEGIN NOW That you may and END
BEGIN NOW very opportunely. END
BEGIN NOW There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my END
BEGIN NOW felicity. END
BEGIN NOW But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet END
BEGIN NOW and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and END
BEGIN NOW find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the END
BEGIN NOW powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good END
BEGIN NOW things. END
BEGIN NOW With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a END
BEGIN NOW complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his END
BEGIN NOW bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very END
BEGIN NOW picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. END
BEGIN NOW Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he END
BEGIN NOW said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting END
BEGIN NOW instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her END
BEGIN NOW feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so END
BEGIN NOW melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been END
BEGIN NOW impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of END
BEGIN NOW such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. END
BEGIN NOW I declare, I was never so END
BEGIN NOW touched in all my life. END
BEGIN NOW God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! END
BEGIN NOW Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her END
BEGIN NOW favours. END
BEGIN NOW A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having END
BEGIN NOW replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. END
BEGIN NOW Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and END
BEGIN NOW universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in END
BEGIN NOW thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, END
BEGIN NOW the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer END
BEGIN NOW years. END
BEGIN NOW But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. END
BEGIN NOW How mingled and END
BEGIN NOW imperfect are all our sublunary joys. END
BEGIN NOW Maledicity! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed in END
BEGIN NOW anguish. END
BEGIN NOW Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my END
BEGIN NOW cloak along! END
BEGIN NOW I could weep to think of it. END
BEGIN NOW Then, though it had poured END
BEGIN NOW seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. END
BEGIN NOW But beshrew me, END
BEGIN NOW he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, END
BEGIN NOW thousand thunders, I know of a marchand de capotes, Monsieur Poyntz, END
BEGIN NOW from whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion END
BEGIN NOW as ever kept a lady from wetting. END
BEGIN NOW Tut, tut! END
BEGIN NOW cries Le FÃ©condateur, END
BEGIN NOW tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller END
BEGIN NOW (I have just cracked a half bottle AVEC LUI in a circle of the best wits END
BEGIN NOW of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have END
BEGIN NOW a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. END
BEGIN NOW A drenching END
BEGIN NOW of that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one END
BEGIN NOW luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. END
BEGIN NOW Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW livre! END
BEGIN NOW cries Monsieur Lynch. END
BEGIN NOW The clumsy things are dear at a sou. END
BEGIN NOW One END
BEGIN NOW umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such END
BEGIN NOW stopgaps. END
BEGIN NOW No woman of any wit would wear one. END
BEGIN NOW My dear Kitty told me END
BEGIN NOW today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in END
BEGIN NOW such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and END
BEGIN NOW whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy END
BEGIN NOW butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in END
BEGIN NOW our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses END
BEGIN NOW for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a END
BEGIN NOW breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her END
BEGIN NOW tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer END
BEGIN NOW chamber of my ear), the first is a bath... END
BEGIN NOW But at this point a bell END
BEGIN NOW tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for END
BEGIN NOW the enrichment of our store of knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while END
BEGIN NOW all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, END
BEGIN NOW having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with END
BEGIN NOW a profound bow to the company. END
BEGIN NOW The presence even for a moment among a END
BEGIN NOW party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and END
BEGIN NOW not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of END
BEGIN NOW the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of END
BEGIN NOW ribaldry. END
BEGIN NOW Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. END
BEGIN NOW A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! END
BEGIN NOW I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused END
BEGIN NOW you. END
BEGIN NOW What, you dog? END
BEGIN NOW Have you a way with them? END
BEGIN NOW Gad's bud, immensely so, END
BEGIN NOW said Mr Lynch. END
BEGIN NOW The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater END
BEGIN NOW hospice. END
BEGIN NOW Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the END
BEGIN NOW chin. END
BEGIN NOW As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid END
BEGIN NOW there any time these seven months. END
BEGIN NOW Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young END
BEGIN NOW blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest END
BEGIN NOW squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! END
BEGIN NOW Drat the man! END
BEGIN NOW Bless me, END
BEGIN NOW I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you're as bad as dear little Father END
BEGIN NOW Cantekissem, that you are! END
BEGIN NOW May this pot of four half choke me, cried END
BEGIN NOW Costello, if she aint in the family way. END
BEGIN NOW I knows a lady what's got a END
BEGIN NOW white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. END
BEGIN NOW The young surgeon, however, END
BEGIN NOW rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just END
BEGIN NOW then informed him that he was needed in the ward. END
BEGIN NOW Merciful providence END
BEGIN NOW had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was END
BEGIN NOW enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given END
BEGIN NOW birth to a bouncing boy. END
BEGIN NOW I want patience, said he, with those who, END
BEGIN NOW without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling END
BEGIN NOW profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest END
BEGIN NOW power for happiness upon the earth. END
BEGIN NOW I am positive when I say that if END
BEGIN NOW need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her END
BEGIN NOW noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a END
BEGIN NOW glorious incentive in the human breast. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot away with them. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her END
BEGIN NOW own sex and the astonishment of ours? END
BEGIN NOW And at an instant the most END
BEGIN NOW momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? END
BEGIN NOW Perish the thought! END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice END
BEGIN NOW have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and END
BEGIN NOW maid in house of Horne. END
BEGIN NOW Having delivered himself of this rebuke he END
BEGIN NOW saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. END
BEGIN NOW A murmur of END
BEGIN NOW approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker END
BEGIN NOW without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he END
BEGIN NOW have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his END
BEGIN NOW transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a END
BEGIN NOW round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew END
BEGIN NOW breath. END
BEGIN NOW Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of END
BEGIN NOW honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy END
BEGIN NOW father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty END
BEGIN NOW pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart. END
BEGIN NOW To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of END
BEGIN NOW some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits END
BEGIN NOW of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. END
BEGIN NOW The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as END
BEGIN NOW overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were END
BEGIN NOW difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and END
BEGIN NOW outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were END
BEGIN NOW they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of END
BEGIN NOW strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. END
BEGIN NOW But the word of Mr Costello END
BEGIN NOW was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that END
BEGIN NOW seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of END
BEGIN NOW wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the END
BEGIN NOW world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a END
BEGIN NOW colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of END
BEGIN NOW creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. END
BEGIN NOW It was now END
BEGIN NOW for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed END
BEGIN NOW through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary END
BEGIN NOW ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to END
BEGIN NOW repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with END
BEGIN NOW the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of END
BEGIN NOW sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find END
BEGIN NOW tolerable and but tolerable. END
BEGIN NOW To those who create themselves wits at the END
BEGIN NOW cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) END
BEGIN NOW to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the END
BEGIN NOW tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all END
BEGIN NOW forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of END
BEGIN NOW experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious END
BEGIN NOW retreat. END
BEGIN NOW Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring END
BEGIN NOW nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever END
BEGIN NOW (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the END
BEGIN NOW tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any END
BEGIN NOW condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful END
BEGIN NOW occasions. END
BEGIN NOW To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned END
BEGIN NOW upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little END
BEGIN NOW alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an END
BEGIN NOW ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to END
BEGIN NOW the bounty of the Supreme Being. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express END
BEGIN NOW his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express END
BEGIN NOW one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not END
BEGIN NOW to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement END
BEGIN NOW since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. END
BEGIN NOW The dressy END
BEGIN NOW young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that expectation END
BEGIN NOW or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to END
BEGIN NOW evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round END
BEGIN NOW again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his END
BEGIN NOW nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. END
BEGIN NOW 'Slife, I'll be round with you. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot but extol the virile potency of END
BEGIN NOW the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. END
BEGIN NOW All fell END
BEGIN NOW to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young END
BEGIN NOW blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been END
BEGIN NOW the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an END
BEGIN NOW itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. END
BEGIN NOW Singular, END
BEGIN NOW communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of END
BEGIN NOW metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the END
BEGIN NOW dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the END
BEGIN NOW mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a END
BEGIN NOW pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of END
BEGIN NOW an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. END
BEGIN NOW But, he END
BEGIN NOW further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in END
BEGIN NOW common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a END
BEGIN NOW feather laugh together. END
BEGIN NOW But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, END
BEGIN NOW has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to END
BEGIN NOW civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal END
BEGIN NOW polity? END
BEGIN NOW Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have END
BEGIN NOW counselled? END
BEGIN NOW During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary END
BEGIN NOW advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that END
BEGIN NOW moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant END
BEGIN NOW at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? END
BEGIN NOW Has he END
BEGIN NOW forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it that from END
BEGIN NOW being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, END
BEGIN NOW if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? END
BEGIN NOW Far be it from END
BEGIN NOW candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of END
BEGIN NOW a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue END
BEGIN NOW but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his END
BEGIN NOW interest not to have done) then be it so. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy woman, she has been END
BEGIN NOW too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to END
BEGIN NOW listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of END
BEGIN NOW the desperate. END
BEGIN NOW He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his END
BEGIN NOW piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt END
BEGIN NOW illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata END
BEGIN NOW of society! END
BEGIN NOW Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary END
BEGIN NOW angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! END
BEGIN NOW In the END
BEGIN NOW question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in END
BEGIN NOW Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing END
BEGIN NOW retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. END
BEGIN NOW It ill END
BEGIN NOW becomes him to preach that gospel. END
BEGIN NOW Has he not nearer home a seedfield END
BEGIN NOW that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? END
BEGIN NOW A habit reprehensible END
BEGIN NOW at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. END
BEGIN NOW If he must END
BEGIN NOW dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste END
BEGIN NOW to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his END
BEGIN NOW practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant END
BEGIN NOW to adduce. END
BEGIN NOW The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for END
BEGIN NOW a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and END
BEGIN NOW healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its END
BEGIN NOW native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, END
BEGIN NOW transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their END
BEGIN NOW quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid END
BEGIN NOW and inoperative. END
BEGIN NOW The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial END
BEGIN NOW usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the END
BEGIN NOW junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the END

BEGIN NOW the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the END
BEGIN NOW afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic END
BEGIN NOW affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous END
BEGIN NOW exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and END
BEGIN NOW solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would END
BEGIN NOW palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and END
BEGIN NOW obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of END
BEGIN NOW tongues. END
BEGIN NOW In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring END
BEGIN NOW to urge, to mollify, to refrain. END
BEGIN NOW The moment was too propitious for the END
BEGIN NOW display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among END
BEGIN NOW tempers so divergent. END
BEGIN NOW Every phase of the situation was successively END
BEGIN NOW eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean END
BEGIN NOW section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, END
BEGIN NOW with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs END

BEGIN NOW The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the END

BEGIN NOW Haines! END
BEGIN NOW Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! END
BEGIN NOW He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a END
BEGIN NOW phial marked Poison. END
BEGIN NOW Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all END
BEGIN NOW faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. END
BEGIN NOW I anticipated some such END
BEGIN NOW reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history END
BEGIN NOW is to blame. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is true. END
BEGIN NOW I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW how I am punished! END
BEGIN NOW The inferno has no terrors for me. END
BEGIN NOW This is the END
BEGIN NOW appearance is on me. END
BEGIN NOW Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, END
BEGIN NOW he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share END

BEGIN NOW My END
BEGIN NOW hell, and Ireland's, is in this life. END
BEGIN NOW It is what I tried to obliterate END

BEGIN NOW Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited END

BEGIN NOW Dope is my only hope... END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Destruction! END
BEGIN NOW The END

BEGIN NOW With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. END

BEGIN NOW Tears gushed END

BEGIN NOW No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing END

BEGIN NOW He is END

BEGIN NOW There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within END

BEGIN NOW That young figure of then END

BEGIN NOW or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a END

BEGIN NOW The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark END

BEGIN NOW There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph. END
BEGIN NOW The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the END

BEGIN NOW A region where grey twilight END

BEGIN NOW Twilight phantoms are END
BEGIN NOW they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely END
BEGIN NOW haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. END
BEGIN NOW Agendath is a waste land, a home of END

BEGIN NOW Netaim, the golden, is no more. END
BEGIN NOW And END

BEGIN NOW Huuh! END
BEGIN NOW Hark! END
BEGIN NOW Huuh! END
BEGIN NOW Parallax stalks behind and goads END
BEGIN NOW them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. END
BEGIN NOW Elk and END
BEGIN NOW yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come END
BEGIN NOW trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. END
BEGIN NOW Ominous revengeful zodiacal END
BEGIN NOW host! END
BEGIN NOW They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the END
BEGIN NOW trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and END
BEGIN NOW crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning END
BEGIN NOW multitude, murderers of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible END
BEGIN NOW gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. END
BEGIN NOW And the equine portent END
BEGIN NOW grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's own END
BEGIN NOW magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. END
BEGIN NOW And lo, wonder END
BEGIN NOW of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the END
BEGIN NOW daystar, the bride, ever virgin. END
BEGIN NOW It is she, Martha, thou lost one, END
BEGIN NOW Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. END
BEGIN NOW How serene does she now END
BEGIN NOW arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, END
BEGIN NOW shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call END
BEGIN NOW it gossamer. END
BEGIN NOW It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it END
BEGIN NOW streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents END
BEGIN NOW of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, END
BEGIN NOW writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad END

BEGIN NOW Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at END
BEGIN NOW school together in Conmee's time. END
BEGIN NOW He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, END
BEGIN NOW Pisistratus. END
BEGIN NOW Where were they now? END
BEGIN NOW Neither knew. END
BEGIN NOW You have spoken of the END
BEGIN NOW past and its phantoms, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Why think of them? END
BEGIN NOW If I call them END
BEGIN NOW into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to END
BEGIN NOW my call? END
BEGIN NOW Who supposes it? END
BEGIN NOW I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending END
BEGIN NOW bard, am lord and giver of their life. END
BEGIN NOW He encircled his gadding hair END
BEGIN NOW with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. END
BEGIN NOW That answer and those END
BEGIN NOW leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something END
BEGIN NOW more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius END
BEGIN NOW father. END
BEGIN NOW All who wish you well hope this for you. END
BEGIN NOW All desire to see you END
BEGIN NOW bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW heartily wish you may not fail them. END
BEGIN NOW O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying END
BEGIN NOW a hand on the shoulder near him. END
BEGIN NOW Have no fear. END
BEGIN NOW He could not leave his END
BEGIN NOW mother an orphan. END
BEGIN NOW The young man's face grew dark. END
BEGIN NOW All could see how hard END
BEGIN NOW it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed END
BEGIN NOW the smart. END
BEGIN NOW Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the END
BEGIN NOW rider's name: Lenehan as much more. END
BEGIN NOW He told them of the race. END
BEGIN NOW The flag END
BEGIN NOW fell and, huuh! END
BEGIN NOW off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with 0. END
BEGIN NOW Madden END
BEGIN NOW up. END
BEGIN NOW She was leading the field. END
BEGIN NOW All hearts were beating. END
BEGIN NOW Even Phyllis END
BEGIN NOW could not contain herself. END
BEGIN NOW She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! END
BEGIN NOW Sceptre wins! END
BEGIN NOW But in the straight on the run home when all were in close END
BEGIN NOW order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. END
BEGIN NOW All END
BEGIN NOW was lost now. END
BEGIN NOW Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. END
BEGIN NOW Juno, she END
BEGIN NOW cried, I am undone. END
BEGIN NOW But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright END
BEGIN NOW casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW tear fell: one only. END
BEGIN NOW A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. END
BEGIN NOW Lane. END
BEGIN NOW Four winners yesterday and three today. END
BEGIN NOW What rider is like him? END
BEGIN NOW Mount END
BEGIN NOW him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter END
BEGIN NOW is still his. END
BEGIN NOW But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. END
BEGIN NOW Mercy on the END
BEGIN NOW luckless! END
BEGIN NOW Poor Sceptre! END
BEGIN NOW he said with a light sigh. END
BEGIN NOW She is not the filly END
BEGIN NOW that she was. END
BEGIN NOW Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. END
BEGIN NOW By gad, END
BEGIN NOW sir, a queen of them. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember her, Vincent? END
BEGIN NOW I wish you could END
BEGIN NOW have seen my queen today, Vincent said. END
BEGIN NOW How young she was and radiant END
BEGIN NOW (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of END
BEGIN NOW muslin, I do not know the right name of it. END
BEGIN NOW The chestnuts that shaded us END
BEGIN NOW were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with END
BEGIN NOW pollen floating by us. END
BEGIN NOW In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked END
BEGIN NOW on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that END
BEGIN NOW Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW But she had nought END
BEGIN NOW for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled END
BEGIN NOW mischievously when I pressed too close. END
BEGIN NOW A week ago she lay ill, four END
BEGIN NOW days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW is more taking then. END
BEGIN NOW Her posies tool Mad romp that she is, she had END
BEGIN NOW pulled her fill as we reclined together. END
BEGIN NOW And in your ear, my friend, you END
BEGIN NOW will not think who met us as we left the field. END
BEGIN NOW Conmee himself! END
BEGIN NOW He was END
BEGIN NOW walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, END
BEGIN NOW a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. END
BEGIN NOW The sweet END
BEGIN NOW creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a END
BEGIN NOW slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the END
BEGIN NOW very trees adore her. END
BEGIN NOW When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely END
BEGIN NOW echo in that little mirror she carries. END
BEGIN NOW But he had been kind. END
BEGIN NOW In going END
BEGIN NOW by he had blessed us. END
BEGIN NOW The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. END
BEGIN NOW If I had END
BEGIN NOW poor luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more END
BEGIN NOW propensely. END
BEGIN NOW He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and END
BEGIN NOW withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. END
BEGIN NOW Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. END
BEGIN NOW His soul is far END
BEGIN NOW away. END
BEGIN NOW It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be END
BEGIN NOW born. END
BEGIN NOW Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the END
BEGIN NOW incorruptible eon of the gods. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not think it, Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW Theosophos END
BEGIN NOW told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian END
BEGIN NOW priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. END
BEGIN NOW The lords of the END
BEGIN NOW moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of END
BEGIN NOW the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were END
BEGIN NOW therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second END
BEGIN NOW constellation. END
BEGIN NOW However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him END
BEGIN NOW being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was END
BEGIN NOW entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the END
BEGIN NOW case at all. END
BEGIN NOW The individual whose visual organs while the above was END
BEGIN NOW going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of END
BEGIN NOW animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody END
BEGIN NOW that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty END
BEGIN NOW speedily in the wrong shop. END
BEGIN NOW During the past four minutes or thereabouts END
BEGIN NOW he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled END
BEGIN NOW by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated END
BEGIN NOW amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was END
BEGIN NOW certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its END
BEGIN NOW scarlet appearance. END
BEGIN NOW He was simply and solely, as it subsequently END
BEGIN NOW transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an END
BEGIN NOW altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment END
BEGIN NOW before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two END
BEGIN NOW or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as END
BEGIN NOW mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually, however, both their END
BEGIN NOW eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was END
BEGIN NOW endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to END
BEGIN NOW help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the END
BEGIN NOW mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and END
BEGIN NOW made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the END
BEGIN NOW same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not END
BEGIN NOW to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. END
BEGIN NOW The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the END
BEGIN NOW course of life. END
BEGIN NOW Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on END
BEGIN NOW the loftiest and most vital. END
BEGIN NOW The high hall of Horne's house had never END
BEGIN NOW beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old END
BEGIN NOW rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so END
BEGIN NOW encyclopaedic. END
BEGIN NOW A gallant scene in truth it made. END
BEGIN NOW Crotthers was there at END
BEGIN NOW the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing END
BEGIN NOW from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. END
BEGIN NOW There too, opposite to him, END
BEGIN NOW was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity END
BEGIN NOW and premature wisdom. END
BEGIN NOW Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to END
BEGIN NOW Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose END
BEGIN NOW the squat form of Madden. END
BEGIN NOW The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant END
BEGIN NOW before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in END
BEGIN NOW explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted END
BEGIN NOW sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi END
BEGIN NOW Roland St John Mulligan. END
BEGIN NOW Lastly at the head of the board was the young END
BEGIN NOW poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical END
BEGIN NOW inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to END
BEGIN NOW right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, END
BEGIN NOW fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the END
BEGIN NOW dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible END
BEGIN NOW dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril END
BEGIN NOW or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous END
BEGIN NOW loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages END
BEGIN NOW yet to come. END
BEGIN NOW It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted END
BEGIN NOW transcendentalism to which Mr S. END
BEGIN NOW Dedalus' (Div. END
BEGIN NOW Scep.) contentions would END
BEGIN NOW appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to END
BEGIN NOW accepted scientific methods. END
BEGIN NOW Science, it cannot be too often repeated, END
BEGIN NOW deals with tangible phenomena. END
BEGIN NOW The man of science like the man in the END
BEGIN NOW street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain END
BEGIN NOW them as best he can. END
BEGIN NOW There may be, it is true, some questions which END
BEGIN NOW science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by END
BEGIN NOW Mr L. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom (Pubb. END
BEGIN NOW Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. END
BEGIN NOW Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary END
BEGIN NOW (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth END
BEGIN NOW of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the END
BEGIN NOW differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to END
BEGIN NOW opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, END
BEGIN NOW Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? END
BEGIN NOW This would be tantamount to a END
BEGIN NOW cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the nisus END
BEGIN NOW formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily END
BEGIN NOW chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. END
BEGIN NOW The other END
BEGIN NOW problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant END
BEGIN NOW mortality. END
BEGIN NOW It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are END
BEGIN NOW all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. END
BEGIN NOW Mr M. END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan (Hyg. END
BEGIN NOW et Eug. END
BEGIN NOW Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our END
BEGIN NOW greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. END
BEGIN NOW by END
BEGIN NOW inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. END
BEGIN NOW These factors, he alleged, and END
BEGIN NOW the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity END
BEGIN NOW posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers END
BEGIN NOW and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of END
BEGIN NOW dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he END
BEGIN NOW said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of END
BEGIN NOW the race. END
BEGIN NOW Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and END
BEGIN NOW all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, END
BEGIN NOW light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the END
BEGIN NOW classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured END
BEGIN NOW photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable END
BEGIN NOW ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months END
BEGIN NOW in a most enjoyable manner. END
BEGIN NOW Mr J. END
BEGIN NOW Crotthers (Disc. END
BEGIN NOW Bacc.) attributes END
BEGIN NOW some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers END
BEGIN NOW subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in END
BEGIN NOW the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, END
BEGIN NOW culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal END
BEGIN NOW abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. END
BEGIN NOW Although the former END
BEGIN NOW (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he END
BEGIN NOW cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity END
BEGIN NOW is too rare to be normative. END
BEGIN NOW In fact when one comes to look into it the END
BEGIN NOW wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they END
BEGIN NOW do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which END
BEGIN NOW often baulk nature in her intentions. END
BEGIN NOW An ingenious suggestion is that END
BEGIN NOW thrown out by Mr V. END
BEGIN NOW Lynch (Bacc. END
BEGIN NOW Arith.) that both natality and END
BEGIN NOW mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, END
BEGIN NOW lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in END
BEGIN NOW fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun END
BEGIN NOW to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our END
BEGIN NOW public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. END
BEGIN NOW Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy END
BEGIN NOW parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs END
BEGIN NOW unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same END
BEGIN NOW marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. END
BEGIN NOW Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for END
BEGIN NOW whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law END
BEGIN NOW of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up END
BEGIN NOW their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the END
BEGIN NOW plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an END
BEGIN NOW increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though END
BEGIN NOW productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is END
BEGIN NOW nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race END
BEGIN NOW in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. END
BEGIN NOW Mr S. END
BEGIN NOW Dedalus' (Div. END
BEGIN NOW Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) END
BEGIN NOW that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and END
BEGIN NOW apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect END
BEGIN NOW imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females END
BEGIN NOW emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak END
BEGIN NOW of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric END
BEGIN NOW relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought END
BEGIN NOW else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. END
BEGIN NOW For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with END
BEGIN NOW the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and END
BEGIN NOW embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things END
BEGIN NOW scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides END
BEGIN NOW himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the END
BEGIN NOW vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the END
BEGIN NOW cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. END
BEGIN NOW In a END
BEGIN NOW recent public controversy with Mr L. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom (Pubb. END
BEGIN NOW Canv.) which took END
BEGIN NOW place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 END
BEGIN NOW and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. END
BEGIN NOW Horne (Lic. END
BEGIN NOW in END
BEGIN NOW Midw., F. END
BEGIN NOW K. END
BEGIN NOW Q. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW P. END
BEGIN NOW I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported END
BEGIN NOW by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into END
BEGIN NOW the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most END
BEGIN NOW complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes—the act of sexual END
BEGIN NOW congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, END
BEGIN NOW to save her own. END
BEGIN NOW At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of END
BEGIN NOW his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured END
BEGIN NOW tone in which it was delivered. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a END
BEGIN NOW happy accouchement. END
BEGIN NOW It had been a weary weary while both for patient and END
BEGIN NOW doctor. END
BEGIN NOW All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman END
BEGIN NOW had manfully helped. END
BEGIN NOW She had. END
BEGIN NOW She had fought the good fight and now she END
BEGIN NOW was very very happy. END
BEGIN NOW Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are END
BEGIN NOW happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. END
BEGIN NOW Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her END
BEGIN NOW eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to END
BEGIN NOW see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent END
BEGIN NOW prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. END
BEGIN NOW And as her END
BEGIN NOW loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have END
BEGIN NOW her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that END
BEGIN NOW mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. END
BEGIN NOW He is older now END
BEGIN NOW (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in END
BEGIN NOW the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious END
BEGIN NOW second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. END
BEGIN NOW O Doady, END
BEGIN NOW loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that END
BEGIN NOW faroff time of the roses! END
BEGIN NOW With the old shake of her pretty head she END
BEGIN NOW recalls those days. END
BEGIN NOW God! END
BEGIN NOW How beautiful now across the mist of years! END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers END
BEGIN NOW and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, END
BEGIN NOW Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little END
BEGIN NOW Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs END
BEGIN NOW of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a END
BEGIN NOW Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. END
BEGIN NOW Young hopeful END
BEGIN NOW will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of END
BEGIN NOW Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. END
BEGIN NOW And so END
BEGIN NOW time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. END
BEGIN NOW No, let no sigh END
BEGIN NOW break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. END
BEGIN NOW And Doady, knock the ashes from END
BEGIN NOW your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for END
BEGIN NOW you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in END
BEGIN NOW the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil END
BEGIN NOW heart to bed, to rest. END
BEGIN NOW He knows and will call in His own good time. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, END
BEGIN NOW to you my hand. END
BEGIN NOW Well done, thou good and faithful servant! END
BEGIN NOW There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil END
BEGIN NOW memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart END
BEGIN NOW but they abide there and wait. END
BEGIN NOW He may suffer their memory to grow dim, END
BEGIN NOW let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself END
BEGIN NOW that they were not or at least were otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Yet a chance word will END
BEGIN NOW call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the END
BEGIN NOW most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and END
BEGIN NOW harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the END
BEGIN NOW evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine. END
BEGIN NOW Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under END
BEGIN NOW her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded END
BEGIN NOW in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful. END
BEGIN NOW The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of END
BEGIN NOW that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied END
BEGIN NOW trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an END
BEGIN NOW unhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. END
BEGIN NOW A scene END
BEGIN NOW disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a END
BEGIN NOW word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present END
BEGIN NOW there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. END
BEGIN NOW A shaven space END
BEGIN NOW of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at END
BEGIN NOW Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but END
BEGIN NOW with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over END
BEGIN NOW the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert END
BEGIN NOW shock. END
BEGIN NOW And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in END
BEGIN NOW thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, END
BEGIN NOW Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in END
BEGIN NOW her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent END

BEGIN NOW BLOOM: (Blows) Providential you came on the scene. END
BEGIN NOW You have a car?... END
BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to END
BEGIN NOW the car brought up against the scaffolding) Two commercials that were END

BEGIN NOW Like princes, faith. END
BEGIN NOW One of them lost two END
BEGIN NOW quid on the race. END
BEGIN NOW Drowning his grief. END
BEGIN NOW And were on for a go with the END

BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. END
BEGIN NOW No, by God, says I. END
BEGIN NOW Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. END
BEGIN NOW (He END

BEGIN NOW Hah, hah, hah! END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: (Tries to laugh) He, he, he! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Matter of fact I was just END

BEGIN NOW (The horse neighs.) END
BEGIN NOW THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! END
BEGIN NOW Hohohohome! END
BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we END
BEGIN NOW left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and END

BEGIN NOW (He laughs) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. END
BEGIN NOW Will I END

BEGIN NOW (Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls END
BEGIN NOW at the horse. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, in gloom, looms down.) END
BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: (Scratches his nape) Sandycove! END
BEGIN NOW (He bends down and calls END
BEGIN NOW to Stephen) Eh! END
BEGIN NOW (He calls again) Eh! END
BEGIN NOW He's covered with shavings anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW Take care they didn't lift anything off him. END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: No, no, no. END
BEGIN NOW I have his money and his hat here and stick. END
BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he'll get over it. END

BEGIN NOW BLOOM: Good night. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just wait and take him along in a few... END
BEGIN NOW (Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. END
BEGIN NOW The horse END
BEGIN NOW harness jingles.) END
BEGIN NOW CORNY KELLEHER: (From the car, standing) Night. END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: Night. END
BEGIN NOW (The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. END
BEGIN NOW The car END
BEGIN NOW and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher on the END
BEGIN NOW sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight. END
BEGIN NOW The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the END
BEGIN NOW farther seat. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. END
BEGIN NOW With thumb END
BEGIN NOW and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the END
BEGIN NOW sleep to continue for what else is to be done. END
BEGIN NOW With a slow nod Bloom END
BEGIN NOW conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. END
BEGIN NOW The car END
BEGIN NOW jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. END
BEGIN NOW Corny Kelleher END
BEGIN NOW again reassuralooms with his hand. END

BEGIN NOW harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, holding END
BEGIN NOW in his hand Stephen's hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands END
BEGIN NOW irresolute. END
BEGIN NOW Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: Eh! END
BEGIN NOW Ho! END
BEGIN NOW (There is no answer; he bends again) Mr Dedalus! END
BEGIN NOW (There END
BEGIN NOW is no answer) The name if you call. END
BEGIN NOW Somnambulist. END
BEGIN NOW (He bends again and END
BEGIN NOW hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form) END
BEGIN NOW Stephen! END
BEGIN NOW (There is no answer. END
BEGIN NOW He calls again.) Stephen! END
BEGIN NOW STEPHEN: (Groans) Who? END
BEGIN NOW Black panther. END
BEGIN NOW Vampire. END
BEGIN NOW (He sighs and stretches END
BEGIN NOW himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels) END
BEGIN NOW Who... END
BEGIN NOW drive... END
BEGIN NOW Fergus now And pierce... END
BEGIN NOW wood's woven shade?... END
BEGIN NOW (He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.) END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: Poetry. END
BEGIN NOW Well educated. END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW (He bends again and undoes the END
BEGIN NOW buttons of Stephen's waistcoat) To breathe. END
BEGIN NOW (He brushes the woodshavings END
BEGIN NOW from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers) One pound seven. END
BEGIN NOW Not END
BEGIN NOW hurt anyhow. END
BEGIN NOW (He listens) What? END
BEGIN NOW STEPHEN: (Murmurs) END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW shadows... END
BEGIN NOW the woods ... END
BEGIN NOW white breast... END
BEGIN NOW dim sea. END
BEGIN NOW (He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, END
BEGIN NOW holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. END
BEGIN NOW A dog barks in the distance. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. END
BEGIN NOW He looks down on END
BEGIN NOW Stephen's face and form.) END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: (Communes with the night) Face reminds me of his poor mother. END
BEGIN NOW In END
BEGIN NOW the shady wood. END
BEGIN NOW The deep white breast. END
BEGIN NOW Ferguson, I think I caught. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW girl. END
BEGIN NOW Some girl. END
BEGIN NOW Best thing could happen him. END
BEGIN NOW (He murmurs)... END
BEGIN NOW swear that END

BEGIN NOW (He murmurs)... END
BEGIN NOW in the rough sands of the sea... END
BEGIN NOW a cabletow's END
BEGIN NOW length from the shore... END
BEGIN NOW where the tide ebbs... END
BEGIN NOW and flows ... END
BEGIN NOW (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips END
BEGIN NOW in the attitude of secret master. END
BEGIN NOW Against the dark wall a figure appears END
BEGIN NOW slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an END
BEGIN NOW eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in END
BEGIN NOW his hand. END
BEGIN NOW He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the END
BEGIN NOW page.) END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM: (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly) Rudy! END

BEGIN NOW — III — END
BEGIN NOW [ 16 ] END
BEGIN NOW Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of END
BEGIN NOW the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up END
BEGIN NOW generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit END
BEGIN NOW unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom END
BEGIN NOW in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water END
BEGIN NOW available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an END
BEGIN NOW expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's END
BEGIN NOW shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge END
BEGIN NOW where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and END
BEGIN NOW soda or a mineral. END
BEGIN NOW But how to get there was the rub. END
BEGIN NOW For the nonce he END
BEGIN NOW was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him END
BEGIN NOW to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means END
BEGIN NOW during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. END
BEGIN NOW So far as he could see he was END
BEGIN NOW rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable END
BEGIN NOW to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then END
BEGIN NOW condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always END
BEGIN NOW assuming that there was such a thing to be found. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly after a END
BEGIN NOW few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to END
BEGIN NOW take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman END
BEGIN NOW service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver END
BEGIN NOW street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier's and the END
BEGIN NOW distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of END
BEGIN NOW Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence END
BEGIN NOW debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. END
BEGIN NOW But END
BEGIN NOW as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for END
BEGIN NOW hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some END
BEGIN NOW fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was END
BEGIN NOW no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was END
BEGIN NOW anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting END
BEGIN NOW a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice. END
BEGIN NOW This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently END
BEGIN NOW there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it END
BEGIN NOW which they accordingly did. END
BEGIN NOW So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the END
BEGIN NOW Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the END
BEGIN NOW direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped END
BEGIN NOW by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to END
BEGIN NOW vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, END
BEGIN NOW entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made END
BEGIN NOW light of the mischance. END
BEGIN NOW So as neither of them were particularly pressed END
BEGIN NOW for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it END
BEGIN NOW cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered END
BEGIN NOW along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a END
BEGIN NOW jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer END
BEGIN NOW happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion Ã END
BEGIN NOW propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little END
BEGIN NOW while back. END
BEGIN NOW They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway END
BEGIN NOW station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was END
BEGIN NOW suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a END
BEGIN NOW not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more END
BEGIN NOW especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course END
BEGIN NOW turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. END
BEGIN NOW Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford END
BEGIN NOW place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's the END
BEGIN NOW stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the END
BEGIN NOW right, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with END
BEGIN NOW internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated END
BEGIN NOW quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our END
BEGIN NOW daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most END
BEGIN NOW indispensable. END
BEGIN NOW Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me END
BEGIN NOW where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the baker's it is said. END
BEGIN NOW En route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet END
BEGIN NOW perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete END
BEGIN NOW possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, END
BEGIN NOW spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame END
BEGIN NOW and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not END
BEGIN NOW as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for END
BEGIN NOW young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking END
BEGIN NOW habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu END
BEGIN NOW for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could END
BEGIN NOW administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. END
BEGIN NOW Highly providential was END
BEGIN NOW the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was END
BEGIN NOW blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the END
BEGIN NOW eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a END
BEGIN NOW candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an END
BEGIN NOW appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the END
BEGIN NOW solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply END
BEGIN NOW spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. END
BEGIN NOW The reason he mentioned END
BEGIN NOW the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, END
BEGIN NOW were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr END
BEGIN NOW Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil END
BEGIN NOW street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. END
BEGIN NOW Never on the END
BEGIN NOW spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for END
BEGIN NOW example, the END
BEGIN NOW guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being END
BEGIN NOW they were paid to protect the upper classes. END
BEGIN NOW Another thing he commented END
BEGIN NOW on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description END
BEGIN NOW liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them END
BEGIN NOW against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and END
BEGIN NOW also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women END
BEGIN NOW of the demimonde ran away with a lot of Â£. END
BEGIN NOW s. END
BEGIN NOW d. END
BEGIN NOW into the bargain and END
BEGIN NOW the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching END
BEGIN NOW the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old END
BEGIN NOW wine in season as both END
BEGIN NOW nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a END
BEGIN NOW good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a END
BEGIN NOW certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to END
BEGIN NOW trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of END
BEGIN NOW others practically. END
BEGIN NOW Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion END
BEGIN NOW of Stephen by all his pubhunting confrÃ¨res but one, a most glaring END
BEGIN NOW piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs. END
BEGIN NOW —And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing END
BEGIN NOW whatsoever of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back END
BEGIN NOW of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier END
BEGIN NOW of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted END
BEGIN NOW their rather lagging footsteps. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen of his own accord stopped for no END
BEGIN NOW special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the END
BEGIN NOW light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker END
BEGIN NOW figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having END
BEGIN NOW happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered END
BEGIN NOW that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's, END
BEGIN NOW Gumley. END
BEGIN NOW To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway END
BEGIN NOW bridge. END
BEGIN NOW —Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said. END
BEGIN NOW A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches END
BEGIN NOW saluted again, calling: END
BEGIN NOW —Night! END
BEGIN NOW Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the END
BEGIN NOW compliment. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch END
BEGIN NOW as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but END
BEGIN NOW nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety END
BEGIN NOW though not funkyish in the least. END
BEGIN NOW Though unusual in the Dublin area he END
BEGIN NOW knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next END
BEGIN NOW to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising END
BEGIN NOW peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded END
BEGIN NOW spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames END
BEGIN NOW embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply END
BEGIN NOW marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell END
BEGIN NOW swoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there END
BEGIN NOW to point a moral, gagged and garrotted. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, END
BEGIN NOW though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's END
BEGIN NOW breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. END
BEGIN NOW Lord John Corley some called him END
BEGIN NOW and his genealogy came about in this wise. END
BEGIN NOW He was the eldest son of END
BEGIN NOW inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a END
BEGIN NOW certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of END
BEGIN NOW a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. END
BEGIN NOW Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of END
BEGIN NOW the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably END
BEGIN NOW fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or END
BEGIN NOW some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed END
BEGIN NOW the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. END
BEGIN NOW This therefore END
BEGIN NOW was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man END
BEGIN NOW who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious END
BEGIN NOW proclivities as Lord John Corley. END
BEGIN NOW Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. END
BEGIN NOW Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. END
BEGIN NOW His friends END
BEGIN NOW had all deserted him. END
BEGIN NOW Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called END
BEGIN NOW him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other END
BEGIN NOW uncalledfor expressions. END
BEGIN NOW He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to END
BEGIN NOW tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all, END
BEGIN NOW to do. END
BEGIN NOW No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was END
BEGIN NOW fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected END
BEGIN NOW through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same END
BEGIN NOW time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to END
BEGIN NOW finish. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow he was all in. END
BEGIN NOW —I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows END
BEGIN NOW I'm on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW —There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' END
BEGIN NOW school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Garrett Deasy. END
BEGIN NOW Try it. END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW may mention my name. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. END
BEGIN NOW I was END
BEGIN NOW never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. END
BEGIN NOW I got stuck END
BEGIN NOW twice in the junior at the christian brothers. END
BEGIN NOW —I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him. END
BEGIN NOW Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to END
BEGIN NOW do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody END
BEGIN NOW tart off the street. END
BEGIN NOW There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs END
BEGIN NOW Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but END
BEGIN NOW M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over END
BEGIN NOW in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person END
BEGIN NOW addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. END
BEGIN NOW He was starving too though he END
BEGIN NOW hadn't said a word about it. END
BEGIN NOW Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it END
BEGIN NOW still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew END
BEGIN NOW that Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly END
BEGIN NOW deserving of much credence. END
BEGIN NOW However haud ignarus malorum miseris END
BEGIN NOW succurrere disco etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck END
BEGIN NOW would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on END
BEGIN NOW the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though END
BEGIN NOW a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. END
BEGIN NOW But the cream of the joke END
BEGIN NOW was nothing would get it out of Corley's head that he was living in END
BEGIN NOW affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food END
BEGIN NOW there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu END
BEGIN NOW so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but END
BEGIN NOW the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash END
BEGIN NOW missing. END
BEGIN NOW A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. END
BEGIN NOW He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as END
BEGIN NOW well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a END
BEGIN NOW pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. END
BEGIN NOW He was altogether too END
BEGIN NOW fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect. END
BEGIN NOW About biscuits he dimly remembered. END
BEGIN NOW Who now exactly gave them he END
BEGIN NOW wondered or where was or did he buy. END
BEGIN NOW However in another pocket he came END
BEGIN NOW across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, END
BEGIN NOW as it turned out. END
BEGIN NOW —Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him. END
BEGIN NOW And so in point of fact they turned out to be. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen anyhow lent him END
BEGIN NOW one of them. END
BEGIN NOW —Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW I'll pay you back one END
BEGIN NOW time. END
BEGIN NOW Who's that with you? END
BEGIN NOW I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse END
BEGIN NOW in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. END
BEGIN NOW You might put in a good END
BEGIN NOW word for us to get me taken on there. END
BEGIN NOW I'd carry a sandwichboard only the END
BEGIN NOW girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, END
BEGIN NOW man. END
BEGIN NOW God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl END
BEGIN NOW Rosa. END
BEGIN NOW I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a END
BEGIN NOW crossing sweeper. END
BEGIN NOW Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six END
BEGIN NOW he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky END
BEGIN NOW that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's, END
BEGIN NOW bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara END
BEGIN NOW and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow he was lagged END
BEGIN NOW the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and END
BEGIN NOW refusing to go with the constable. END
BEGIN NOW 210 END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the END
BEGIN NOW cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation END
BEGIN NOW watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, END
BEGIN NOW was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own END
BEGIN NOW private account while Dublin slept. END
BEGIN NOW He threw an odd eye at the same time END
BEGIN NOW now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor END
BEGIN NOW as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was END
BEGIN NOW not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. END
BEGIN NOW Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in END
BEGIN NOW point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat END
BEGIN NOW and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic END
BEGIN NOW impecuniosity. END
BEGIN NOW Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter END
BEGIN NOW of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor END
BEGIN NOW neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for END
BEGIN NOW the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock END
BEGIN NOW himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a END
BEGIN NOW very rara avis altogether. END
BEGIN NOW In any case he had a consummate amount of END
BEGIN NOW cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty thick that was certainly. END
BEGIN NOW The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his END
BEGIN NOW practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the END
BEGIN NOW blandiloquence of the other parasite. END
BEGIN NOW Alluding to the encounter he said, END
BEGIN NOW laughingly, Stephen, that is: END
BEGIN NOW —He is down on his luck. END
BEGIN NOW He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named END
BEGIN NOW Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman. END
BEGIN NOW At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the END
BEGIN NOW direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, END
BEGIN NOW moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, END
BEGIN NOW whereupon he observed evasively: END
BEGIN NOW —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Now you mention it END
BEGIN NOW his face was familiar to me. END
BEGIN NOW But, leaving that for the moment, how much END
BEGIN NOW did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive? END
BEGIN NOW —Half a crown, Stephen responded. END
BEGIN NOW I daresay he needs it to sleep END
BEGIN NOW somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW —Needs! END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the END
BEGIN NOW intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he END
BEGIN NOW invariably does. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone according to his needs or everyone according END
BEGIN NOW to his deeds. END
BEGIN NOW But, talking about things in general, where, added he with END
BEGIN NOW a smile, will you sleep yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Walking to Sandycove is out of the END
BEGIN NOW question. END
BEGIN NOW And even supposing you did you won't get in after what END
BEGIN NOW occurred at Westland Row station. END
BEGIN NOW Simply fag out there for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why END
BEGIN NOW did you leave your father's house? END
BEGIN NOW —To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer. END
BEGIN NOW —I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom END
BEGIN NOW diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on END
BEGIN NOW yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Where does he live at present? END
BEGIN NOW I gathered in the course of END
BEGIN NOW conversation that he had moved. END
BEGIN NOW —I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW —A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than END
BEGIN NOW one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. END
BEGIN NOW He takes great pride, END
BEGIN NOW quite legitimate, out of you. END
BEGIN NOW You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, END
BEGIN NOW still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus END
BEGIN NOW when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and END
BEGIN NOW that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third END
BEGIN NOW companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged END
BEGIN NOW to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did. END
BEGIN NOW There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it END
BEGIN NOW was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his END
BEGIN NOW family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by END
BEGIN NOW the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell END
BEGIN NOW cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he END
BEGIN NOW could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings END
BEGIN NOW they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and END
BEGIN NOW Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells END
BEGIN NOW and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in END
BEGIN NOW accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on END
BEGIN NOW the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or END
BEGIN NOW something like that. END
BEGIN NOW —No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in END
BEGIN NOW that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr END
BEGIN NOW Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he END
BEGIN NOW never realised what it is to be without regular meals. END
BEGIN NOW Of course you END
BEGIN NOW didn't notice as much as I did. END
BEGIN NOW But it wouldn't occasion me the least END
BEGIN NOW surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in END
BEGIN NOW your drink for some ulterior object. END
BEGIN NOW He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile END
BEGIN NOW allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly END
BEGIN NOW coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade END
BEGIN NOW fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a END
BEGIN NOW tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in END
BEGIN NOW addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from END
BEGIN NOW certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid END
BEGIN NOW at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an END
BEGIN NOW exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that END
BEGIN NOW frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be END
BEGIN NOW at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, END
BEGIN NOW pure and simple. END
BEGIN NOW —Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking END
BEGIN NOW your brains, he ventured to throw out. END
BEGIN NOW The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by END
BEGIN NOW friendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of END
BEGIN NOW features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the END
BEGIN NOW problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by END
BEGIN NOW two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw END
BEGIN NOW through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself END
BEGIN NOW allowed matters to more or less. END
BEGIN NOW Grinding poverty did have that effect END
BEGIN NOW and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he END
BEGIN NOW possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet. END
BEGIN NOW Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car round END
BEGIN NOW which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting END
BEGIN NOW rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly END
BEGIN NOW animated way, there being some little differences between the parties. END
BEGIN NOW —Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! END
BEGIN NOW Ho ragione? END
BEGIN NOW Culo rotto! END
BEGIN NOW —Intendiamoci. END
BEGIN NOW Mezzo sovrano piu... END
BEGIN NOW —Dice lui, pero! END
BEGIN NOW —Mezzo. END
BEGIN NOW —Farabutto! END
BEGIN NOW Mortacci sui! END
BEGIN NOW —Ma ascolta! END
BEGIN NOW Cinque la testa piu... END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious END
BEGIN NOW wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been END
BEGIN NOW before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints END
BEGIN NOW anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat END
BEGIN NOW Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual END
BEGIN NOW facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. END
BEGIN NOW A few END
BEGIN NOW moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner END
BEGIN NOW only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection END
BEGIN NOW of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo END
BEGIN NOW already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation END
BEGIN NOW for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. END
BEGIN NOW —Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to END
BEGIN NOW break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the END
BEGIN NOW shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order END
BEGIN NOW these commodities quietly. END
BEGIN NOW The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or END
BEGIN NOW whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes END
BEGIN NOW apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual END
BEGIN NOW portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for END
BEGIN NOW some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the END
BEGIN NOW floor. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having END
BEGIN NOW just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be END
BEGIN NOW sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protÃ©gÃ© in an END
BEGIN NOW audible tone of voice a propos of the battle royal in the street which END
BEGIN NOW was still raging fast and furious: END
BEGIN NOW —A beautiful language. END
BEGIN NOW I mean for singing purposes. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you not write END
BEGIN NOW your poetry in that language? END
BEGIN NOW Bella Poetria! END
BEGIN NOW It is so melodious and END
BEGIN NOW full. END
BEGIN NOW Belladonna. END
BEGIN NOW Voglio. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering END
BEGIN NOW from lassitude generally, replied: END
BEGIN NOW —To fill the ear of a cow elephant. END
BEGIN NOW They were haggling over money. END
BEGIN NOW —Is that so? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom asked. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the END
BEGIN NOW inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were END
BEGIN NOW absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds END
BEGIN NOW it. END
BEGIN NOW The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tÃªte-Ã¢-tÃªte put a END
BEGIN NOW boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table END
BEGIN NOW and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. END
BEGIN NOW After END
BEGIN NOW which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a END
BEGIN NOW good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. END
BEGIN NOW For which END
BEGIN NOW reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the END
BEGIN NOW honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily END
BEGIN NOW supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him. END
BEGIN NOW —Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, END
BEGIN NOW like names. END
BEGIN NOW Cicero, Podmore. END
BEGIN NOW Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, Mr Doyle. END
BEGIN NOW Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. END
BEGIN NOW What's in a name? END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. END
BEGIN NOW Of course. END
BEGIN NOW Our name END
BEGIN NOW was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across. END
BEGIN NOW The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely END
BEGIN NOW by asking: END
BEGIN NOW —And what might your name be? END
BEGIN NOW Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected END
BEGIN NOW quarter, answered: END
BEGIN NOW —Dedalus. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, END
BEGIN NOW rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old END
BEGIN NOW Hollands and water. END
BEGIN NOW —You know Simon Dedalus? END
BEGIN NOW he asked at length. END
BEGIN NOW —I've heard of him, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently END
BEGIN NOW eavesdropping too. END
BEGIN NOW —He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same END
BEGIN NOW way and nodding. END
BEGIN NOW All Irish. END
BEGIN NOW —All too Irish, Stephen rejoined. END
BEGIN NOW As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business END
BEGIN NOW and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor END
BEGIN NOW of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the END
BEGIN NOW remark: END
BEGIN NOW —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his END
BEGIN NOW shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW The lefthand dead shot. END
BEGIN NOW Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his END
BEGIN NOW gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. END
BEGIN NOW —Bottles out there, say. END
BEGIN NOW Fifty yards measured. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs on the bottles. END
BEGIN NOW Cocks his gun over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Aims. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. END
BEGIN NOW Then he END
BEGIN NOW screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night END
BEGIN NOW with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. END
BEGIN NOW —Pom! END
BEGIN NOW he then shouted once. END
BEGIN NOW The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there END
BEGIN NOW being still a further egg. END
BEGIN NOW —Pom! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted twice. END
BEGIN NOW Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding END
BEGIN NOW bloodthirstily: END
BEGIN NOW —Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never will. END
BEGIN NOW A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like END
BEGIN NOW asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the END
BEGIN NOW Bisley. END
BEGIN NOW —Beg pardon, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW —Long ago? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic END
BEGIN NOW influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. END
BEGIN NOW I seen him do that in END
BEGIN NOW Stockholm. END
BEGIN NOW —Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively. END
BEGIN NOW —Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. END
BEGIN NOW D. END
BEGIN NOW B. END
BEGIN NOW Murphy of Carrigaloe. END
BEGIN NOW Know where that is? END
BEGIN NOW —Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied. END
BEGIN NOW —That's right, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. END
BEGIN NOW That's END
BEGIN NOW where I hails from. END
BEGIN NOW I belongs there. END
BEGIN NOW That's where I hails from. END
BEGIN NOW My END
BEGIN NOW little woman's down there. END
BEGIN NOW She's waiting for me, I know. END
BEGIN NOW For England, END
BEGIN NOW home and beauty. END
BEGIN NOW She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years END
BEGIN NOW now, sailing about. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming END
BEGIN NOW to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a END
BEGIN NOW rainy night with a blind moon. END
BEGIN NOW Across the world for a wife. END
BEGIN NOW Quite a END
BEGIN NOW number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, END
BEGIN NOW Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc END
BEGIN NOW O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of END
BEGIN NOW poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. END
BEGIN NOW Never END
BEGIN NOW about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the END
BEGIN NOW absentee. END
BEGIN NOW The face at the window! END
BEGIN NOW Judge of his astonishment when he END
BEGIN NOW finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent END
BEGIN NOW his better half, wrecked in his affections. END
BEGIN NOW You little expected me but END
BEGIN NOW I've come to stay and make a fresh start. END
BEGIN NOW There she sits, a grasswidow, END
BEGIN NOW at the selfsame fireside. END
BEGIN NOW Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the END
BEGIN NOW deep. END
BEGIN NOW And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the END
BEGIN NOW publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and END
BEGIN NOW onions. END
BEGIN NOW No chair for father. END
BEGIN NOW Broo! END
BEGIN NOW The wind! END
BEGIN NOW Her brandnew arrival is on END
BEGIN NOW her knee, post mortem child. END
BEGIN NOW With a high ro! END
BEGIN NOW and a randy ro! END
BEGIN NOW and my END
BEGIN NOW galloping tearing tandy, O! END
BEGIN NOW Bow to the inevitable. END
BEGIN NOW Grin and bear it. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW remain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one END
BEGIN NOW of the jarvies with the request: END
BEGIN NOW —You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you? END
BEGIN NOW The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of END
BEGIN NOW plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was END
BEGIN NOW passed from hand to hand. END
BEGIN NOW —Thank you, the sailor said. END
BEGIN NOW He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow END
BEGIN NOW stammers, proceeded: END
BEGIN NOW —We come up this morning eleven o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW The threemaster Rosevean from END
BEGIN NOW Bridgwater with bricks. END
BEGIN NOW I shipped to get over. END
BEGIN NOW Paid off this afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW There's my discharge. END
BEGIN NOW See? END
BEGIN NOW D. END
BEGIN NOW B. END
BEGIN NOW Murphy. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW B. END
BEGIN NOW S. END
BEGIN NOW In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket END
BEGIN NOW and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document. END
BEGIN NOW —You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, END
BEGIN NOW leaning on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated END
BEGIN NOW a bit since I first joined on. END
BEGIN NOW I was in the Red Sea. END
BEGIN NOW I was in China and END
BEGIN NOW North America and South America. END
BEGIN NOW We was chased by pirates one voyage. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW seen icebergs plenty, growlers. END
BEGIN NOW I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, END
BEGIN NOW the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever END
BEGIN NOW scuttled a ship. END
BEGIN NOW I seen Russia. END
BEGIN NOW Gospodi pomilyou. END
BEGIN NOW That's how the END
BEGIN NOW Russians prays. END
BEGIN NOW —You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. END
BEGIN NOW I seen queer END
BEGIN NOW things too, ups and downs. END
BEGIN NOW I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an END
BEGIN NOW anchor same as I chew that quid. END
BEGIN NOW He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his END
BEGIN NOW teeth, bit ferociously: END
BEGIN NOW —Khaan! END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and END
BEGIN NOW the livers of horses. END
BEGIN NOW Look here. END
BEGIN NOW Here they are. END
BEGIN NOW A friend of mine sent END
BEGIN NOW me. END
BEGIN NOW He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to END
BEGIN NOW be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. END
BEGIN NOW Beni, Bolivia. END
BEGIN NOW All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage END
BEGIN NOW women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, END
BEGIN NOW sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of END
BEGIN NOW them) outside some primitive shanties of osier. END
BEGIN NOW —Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. END
BEGIN NOW Stomachs like END
BEGIN NOW breadgraters. END
BEGIN NOW Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more END
BEGIN NOW children. END
BEGIN NOW See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver END
BEGIN NOW raw. END
BEGIN NOW His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for END
BEGIN NOW several minutes if not more. END
BEGIN NOW —Know how to keep them off? END
BEGIN NOW he inquired generally. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: END
BEGIN NOW —Glass. END
BEGIN NOW That boggles 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Glass. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the END
BEGIN NOW card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. END
BEGIN NOW It ran as END
BEGIN NOW follows: Tarjeta Postal, SeÃ±or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, END
BEGIN NOW Chile. END
BEGIN NOW There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. END
BEGIN NOW Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the END
BEGIN NOW eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the END
BEGIN NOW Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which END
BEGIN NOW occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having END
BEGIN NOW detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he END
BEGIN NOW represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after END
BEGIN NOW having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. END
BEGIN NOW somewhere) and the END
BEGIN NOW fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some END
BEGIN NOW suspicions of our friend's bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a END
BEGIN NOW way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday END
BEGIN NOW or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had END
BEGIN NOW ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a END
BEGIN NOW born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a END
BEGIN NOW landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but END
BEGIN NOW some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that END
BEGIN NOW the scheme fell through. END
BEGIN NOW But even suppose it did come to planking down END
BEGIN NOW the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse END
BEGIN NOW permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to END
BEGIN NOW Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. END
BEGIN NOW The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in END
BEGIN NOW every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was END
BEGIN NOW out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, END
BEGIN NOW Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of END
BEGIN NOW the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon END
BEGIN NOW where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, END
BEGIN NOW wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. END
BEGIN NOW Another thing just END
BEGIN NOW struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around END
BEGIN NOW on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert END
BEGIN NOW tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, END
BEGIN NOW Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, END
BEGIN NOW Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel END
BEGIN NOW islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. END
BEGIN NOW Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies END
BEGIN NOW on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise and I'll post END
BEGIN NOW you the ticket. END
BEGIN NOW No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the END
BEGIN NOW Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading END
BEGIN NOW lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, END
BEGIN NOW perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing END
BEGIN NOW puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of END
BEGIN NOW bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business END
BEGIN NOW with pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW But who? END
BEGIN NOW That was the rub. END
BEGIN NOW Also, without being actually END
BEGIN NOW positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of END
BEGIN NOW opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the END
BEGIN NOW Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the END
BEGIN NOW tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red END
BEGIN NOW tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet END
BEGIN NOW the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. END
BEGIN NOW Brown, Robinson and Co. END
BEGIN NOW It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no END
BEGIN NOW small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the END
BEGIN NOW system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry END
BEGIN NOW pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead END
BEGIN NOW of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me END
BEGIN NOW for a wife. END
BEGIN NOW After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum END
BEGIN NOW months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of END
BEGIN NOW city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her END
BEGIN NOW spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. END
BEGIN NOW There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home END
BEGIN NOW island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of END
BEGIN NOW attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around END
BEGIN NOW Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was END
BEGIN NOW a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, END
BEGIN NOW rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly END
BEGIN NOW wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal END
BEGIN NOW where if report spoke true the coup d'Å“il was exceedingly grand though END
BEGIN NOW the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of END
BEGIN NOW visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal END
BEGIN NOW benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic END
BEGIN NOW associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, END
BEGIN NOW rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt END
BEGIN NOW with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young END
BEGIN NOW men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the END
BEGIN NOW cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left END
BEGIN NOW leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the END
BEGIN NOW pillar. END
BEGIN NOW Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely END
BEGIN NOW in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be END
BEGIN NOW desired. END
BEGIN NOW Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of END
BEGIN NOW curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created END
BEGIN NOW the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. END
BEGIN NOW He turned back the END
BEGIN NOW other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen. END
BEGIN NOW —I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had END
BEGIN NOW little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and END
BEGIN NOW every pill was something different. END
BEGIN NOW One was a ship, another was a house, END
BEGIN NOW another was a flower. END
BEGIN NOW Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, END
BEGIN NOW the chinks does. END
BEGIN NOW Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the END
BEGIN NOW globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures. END
BEGIN NOW —And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. END
BEGIN NOW Knife in his END
BEGIN NOW back. END
BEGIN NOW Knife like that. END
BEGIN NOW Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in END
BEGIN NOW keeping with his character and held it in the striking position. END
BEGIN NOW —In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow END
BEGIN NOW hid behind a door, come up behind him. END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW Prepare to meet your END
BEGIN NOW God, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Chuk! END
BEGIN NOW It went into his back up to the butt. END
BEGIN NOW His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further END
BEGIN NOW questions even should they by any chance want to. END
BEGIN NOW —That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable END
BEGIN NOW stiletto. END
BEGIN NOW After which harrowing dÃ©nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he END
BEGIN NOW snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in END
BEGIN NOW his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket. END
BEGIN NOW —They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in END
BEGIN NOW the dark said for the benefit of them all. END
BEGIN NOW That was why they thought the END
BEGIN NOW park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of END
BEGIN NOW them using knives. END
BEGIN NOW At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is END
BEGIN NOW bliss Mr B. END
BEGIN NOW and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both END
BEGIN NOW instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the END
BEGIN NOW strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias END
BEGIN NOW the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his END
BEGIN NOW boiler affair. END
BEGIN NOW His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a END
BEGIN NOW perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression END
BEGIN NOW that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. END
BEGIN NOW Funny, very! END
BEGIN NOW There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. END
BEGIN NOW One man was reading in fits and END
BEGIN NOW starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the END
BEGIN NOW natives choza de, another the seaman's discharge. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, so far as he END
BEGIN NOW was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. END
BEGIN NOW He vividly END
BEGIN NOW recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as END
BEGIN NOW yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the END
BEGIN NOW land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively END
BEGIN NOW speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was END
BEGIN NOW just turned fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. END
BEGIN NOW Give us back them papers. END
BEGIN NOW The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape. END
BEGIN NOW —Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom inquired. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or END
BEGIN NOW no. END
BEGIN NOW —Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he END
BEGIN NOW had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but END
BEGIN NOW he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, END
BEGIN NOW and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. END
BEGIN NOW —What year would that be about? END
BEGIN NOW Mr B interrogated. END
BEGIN NOW Can you recall the END
BEGIN NOW boats? END
BEGIN NOW Our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: END
BEGIN NOW —I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. END
BEGIN NOW Salt junk all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Tired seemingly, he ceased. END
BEGIN NOW His questioner perceiving that he was not END
BEGIN NOW likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, END
BEGIN NOW fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the END
BEGIN NOW globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, END
BEGIN NOW it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly END
BEGIN NOW what it meant to rule the waves. END
BEGIN NOW On more than one occasion, a dozen at END
BEGIN NOW the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a END
BEGIN NOW superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the END
BEGIN NOW not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at END
BEGIN NOW it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone END
BEGIN NOW somewhere sings. END
BEGIN NOW And it left him wondering why. END
BEGIN NOW Possibly he had tried to END
BEGIN NOW find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes END
BEGIN NOW and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, END
BEGIN NOW tempting the fates. END
BEGIN NOW And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no END
BEGIN NOW secret about it at all. END
BEGIN NOW Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of END
BEGIN NOW the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all END
BEGIN NOW its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to END
BEGIN NOW sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to END
BEGIN NOW show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the END
BEGIN NOW other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were END
BEGIN NOW run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no END
BEGIN NOW other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the END
BEGIN NOW public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case END
BEGIN NOW might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its END
BEGIN NOW gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to END
BEGIN NOW man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the END
BEGIN NOW season when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and END
BEGIN NOW sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the END
BEGIN NOW Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding END
BEGIN NOW which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, END
BEGIN NOW not to say stormy, weather. END
BEGIN NOW —There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself END
BEGIN NOW a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's END
BEGIN NOW valet at six quid a month. END
BEGIN NOW Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave END
BEGIN NOW me an oilskin and that jackknife. END
BEGIN NOW I'm game for that job, shaving and END
BEGIN NOW brushup. END
BEGIN NOW I hate roaming about. END
BEGIN NOW There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea END
BEGIN NOW and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be END
BEGIN NOW drawing easy money. END
BEGIN NOW —What age is he? END
BEGIN NOW queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, END
BEGIN NOW bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from END
BEGIN NOW the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and END
BEGIN NOW a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny? END
BEGIN NOW He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it. END
BEGIN NOW The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow END
BEGIN NOW shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to END
BEGIN NOW be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an END
BEGIN NOW anchor. END
BEGIN NOW —There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW must get a wash tomorrow or next day. END
BEGIN NOW It's them black lads I objects to. END
BEGIN NOW I hate those buggers. END
BEGIN NOW Suck your blood dry, they does. END
BEGIN NOW Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his END
BEGIN NOW shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the END
BEGIN NOW mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a END
BEGIN NOW young man's sideface looking frowningly rather. END
BEGIN NOW —Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. END
BEGIN NOW That was done when we were Iying END
BEGIN NOW becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow, the END
BEGIN NOW name of Antonio, done that. END
BEGIN NOW There he is himself, a Greek. END
BEGIN NOW —Did it hurt much doing it? END
BEGIN NOW one asked the sailor. END
BEGIN NOW That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. END
BEGIN NOW Someway in his. END
BEGIN NOW Squeezing or. END
BEGIN NOW —See here, he said, showing Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW There he is cursing the mate. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his END
BEGIN NOW fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn. END
BEGIN NOW And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did END
BEGIN NOW actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the END
BEGIN NOW unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this END
BEGIN NOW time stretched over. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. END
BEGIN NOW He's gone END
BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW Ate by sharks after. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, ay. END
BEGIN NOW He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression END
BEGIN NOW of before. END
BEGIN NOW —Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said. END
BEGIN NOW —And what's the number for? END
BEGIN NOW loafer number two queried. END
BEGIN NOW —Eaten alive? END
BEGIN NOW a third asked the sailor. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with END
BEGIN NOW some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of END
BEGIN NOW the questioner about the number. END
BEGIN NOW Ate. END
BEGIN NOW A Greek he was. END
BEGIN NOW And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged END
BEGIN NOW end: END
BEGIN NOW —As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio. END
BEGIN NOW The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat END
BEGIN NOW peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her END
BEGIN NOW own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom, END
BEGIN NOW scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment END
BEGIN NOW flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink END
BEGIN NOW sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had END
BEGIN NOW laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though END
BEGIN NOW why pink. END
BEGIN NOW His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round END
BEGIN NOW the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that END
BEGIN NOW afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the END
BEGIN NOW lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) END
BEGIN NOW and begged the chance of his washing. END
BEGIN NOW Also why washing which seemed END
BEGIN NOW rather vague than not, your washing. END
BEGIN NOW Still candour compelled him to END
BEGIN NOW admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles END
BEGIN NOW street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled END
BEGIN NOW with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really END
BEGIN NOW loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Still just END
BEGIN NOW then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her END
BEGIN NOW company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude END
BEGIN NOW sign to take herself off. END
BEGIN NOW Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he END
BEGIN NOW just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door END
BEGIN NOW with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all END
BEGIN NOW there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper END
BEGIN NOW Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her. END
BEGIN NOW —The gunboat, the keeper said. END
BEGIN NOW —It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how END
BEGIN NOW a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with END
BEGIN NOW disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober END
BEGIN NOW senses, if he values his health in the least. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunate creature! END
BEGIN NOW Of END
BEGIN NOW course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. END
BEGIN NOW Still no matter what the cause is from... END
BEGIN NOW Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely END
BEGIN NOW remarking: END
BEGIN NOW —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a END
BEGIN NOW roaring trade. END
BEGIN NOW Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to END
BEGIN NOW buy the soul. END
BEGIN NOW She is a bad merchant. END
BEGIN NOW She buys dear and sells cheap. END
BEGIN NOW The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, END
BEGIN NOW said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a END
BEGIN NOW stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any END
BEGIN NOW oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, w ere not END
BEGIN NOW licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he END
BEGIN NOW could truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate END
BEGIN NOW of from the very first start. END
BEGIN NOW Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, END
BEGIN NOW he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting END
BEGIN NOW boon on everybody concerned. END
BEGIN NOW —You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe END
BEGIN NOW in the soul. END
BEGIN NOW Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as END
BEGIN NOW distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as END
BEGIN NOW the convolutions of the grey matter. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise we would never have such END
BEGIN NOW inventions as X rays, for instance. END
BEGIN NOW Do you? END
BEGIN NOW Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try END
BEGIN NOW and concentrate and remember before he could say: END
BEGIN NOW —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and END
BEGIN NOW therefore incorruptible. END
BEGIN NOW It would be immortal, I understand, but for the END
BEGIN NOW possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can END
BEGIN NOW hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other END
BEGIN NOW practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being END
BEGIN NOW excluded by court etiquette. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the END
BEGIN NOW mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he END
BEGIN NOW felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly END
BEGIN NOW rejoining: END
BEGIN NOW —Simple? END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn't think that is the proper word. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, I grant END
BEGIN NOW you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a END
BEGIN NOW blue moon. END
BEGIN NOW But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for END
BEGIN NOW instance to invent those rays RÃ¶ntgen did or the telescope like Edison, END
BEGIN NOW though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and END
BEGIN NOW the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural END
BEGIN NOW phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour END
BEGIN NOW to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God. END
BEGIN NOW —O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several END
BEGIN NOW of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial END
BEGIN NOW evidence. END
BEGIN NOW On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they END
BEGIN NOW were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in END
BEGIN NOW their respective ages, clashed. END
BEGIN NOW —Has been? END
BEGIN NOW the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his END
BEGIN NOW original point with a smile of unbelief. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not so sure about that. END
BEGIN NOW That's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the END
BEGIN NOW sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. END
BEGIN NOW My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine END
BEGIN NOW forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big END
BEGIN NOW question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like END
BEGIN NOW Hamlet and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better END
BEGIN NOW than I, of course I needn't tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Can't you drink that coffee, by END
BEGIN NOW the way? END
BEGIN NOW Let me stir it. END
BEGIN NOW And take a piece of that bun. END
BEGIN NOW It's like one of END
BEGIN NOW our skipper's bricks disguised. END
BEGIN NOW Still no-one can give what he hasn't END
BEGIN NOW got. END
BEGIN NOW Try a bit. END
BEGIN NOW —Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the END
BEGIN NOW moment refusing to dictate further. END
BEGIN NOW Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir END
BEGIN NOW or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something END
BEGIN NOW approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and END
BEGIN NOW lucrative) work. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or END
BEGIN NOW nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in END
BEGIN NOW run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings END
BEGIN NOW and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower END
BEGIN NOW orders. END
BEGIN NOW On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection END
BEGIN NOW they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently END
BEGIN NOW associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for END
BEGIN NOW her pianoplaying. END
BEGIN NOW The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to END
BEGIN NOW do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. END
BEGIN NOW Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he END
BEGIN NOW remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't END
BEGIN NOW remember when it was or where. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of END
BEGIN NOW all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly END
BEGIN NOW accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the END
BEGIN NOW medical analysis involved. END
BEGIN NOW —Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being END
BEGIN NOW stirred. END
BEGIN NOW Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug END
BEGIN NOW from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and END
BEGIN NOW took a sip of the offending beverage. END
BEGIN NOW —Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid END
BEGIN NOW food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but END
BEGIN NOW regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or END
BEGIN NOW manual. END
BEGIN NOW You ought to eat more solid food. END
BEGIN NOW You would feel a different END
BEGIN NOW man. END
BEGIN NOW —Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW But O, oblige me by taking away that END
BEGIN NOW knife. END
BEGIN NOW I can't look at the point of it. END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me of Roman history. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, END
BEGIN NOW a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or END
BEGIN NOW antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least END
BEGIN NOW conspicuous point about it. END
BEGIN NOW —Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of END
BEGIN NOW knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think they are END
BEGIN NOW genuine? END
BEGIN NOW He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and END
BEGIN NOW lie like old boots. END
BEGIN NOW Look at him. END
BEGIN NOW Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was END
BEGIN NOW full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it END
BEGIN NOW was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire END
BEGIN NOW fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent END
BEGIN NOW probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly END
BEGIN NOW accurate gospel. END
BEGIN NOW He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and END
BEGIN NOW Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. END
BEGIN NOW Though a END
BEGIN NOW wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, END
BEGIN NOW there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail END
BEGIN NOW delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate END
BEGIN NOW such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, END
BEGIN NOW as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and END
BEGIN NOW had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say END
BEGIN NOW nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage END
BEGIN NOW of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who END
BEGIN NOW expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. END
BEGIN NOW On the END
BEGIN NOW other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because END
BEGIN NOW meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting END
BEGIN NOW news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean END
BEGIN NOW seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't END
BEGIN NOW probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other END
BEGIN NOW fellows coined about him. END
BEGIN NOW —Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. END
BEGIN NOW Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. END
BEGIN NOW Giants, END
BEGIN NOW though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the END
BEGIN NOW midget queen. END
BEGIN NOW In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some END
BEGIN NOW Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten END
BEGIN NOW their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he END
BEGIN NOW proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews END
BEGIN NOW or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly END
BEGIN NOW powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as END
BEGIN NOW gods. END
BEGIN NOW There's an example again of simple souls. END
BEGIN NOW However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who END
BEGIN NOW reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the END
BEGIN NOW boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the END
BEGIN NOW management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of END
BEGIN NOW admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him END
BEGIN NOW though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually END
BEGIN NOW fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically END
BEGIN NOW incompatible about it, he conceded. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary that stab in the END
BEGIN NOW back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he END
BEGIN NOW was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish END
BEGIN NOW way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little END
BEGIN NOW Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows END
BEGIN NOW except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary END
BEGIN NOW animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good END
BEGIN NOW old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on END
BEGIN NOW the quiet and, he added, on the cheap. END
BEGIN NOW —Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like END
BEGIN NOW that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own END
BEGIN NOW hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they END
BEGIN NOW carry in the abdomen. END
BEGIN NOW It comes from the great heat, climate generally. END
BEGIN NOW My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. END
BEGIN NOW Point of fact she could END
BEGIN NOW actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in END
BEGIN NOW (technically) Spain, i.e. END
BEGIN NOW Gibraltar. END
BEGIN NOW She has the Spanish type. END
BEGIN NOW Quite END
BEGIN NOW dark, regular brunette, black. END
BEGIN NOW I for one certainly believe climate END
BEGIN NOW accounts for character. END
BEGIN NOW That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry END
BEGIN NOW in Italian. END
BEGIN NOW —The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very END
BEGIN NOW passionate about ten shillings. END
BEGIN NOW Roberto ruba roba sua. END
BEGIN NOW —Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed. END
BEGIN NOW —Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown END
BEGIN NOW listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles END
BEGIN NOW triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san END
BEGIN NOW Tommaso Mastino. END
BEGIN NOW —It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. END
BEGIN NOW All are washed in the END
BEGIN NOW blood of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare END
BEGIN NOW street museum 890 today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call END
BEGIN NOW it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. END
BEGIN NOW The splendid END
BEGIN NOW proportions of hips, bosom. END
BEGIN NOW You simply don't knock against those kind of END
BEGIN NOW women here. END
BEGIN NOW An exception here and there. END
BEGIN NOW Handsome yes, pretty in a way END
BEGIN NOW you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. END
BEGIN NOW Besides they END
BEGIN NOW have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a END
BEGIN NOW woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. END
BEGIN NOW Rumpled stockings, it END
BEGIN NOW may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a thing I simply END
BEGIN NOW hate to see. END
BEGIN NOW Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the END
BEGIN NOW others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, END
BEGIN NOW goo collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW Shipahoy of course END
BEGIN NOW had his own say to say. END
BEGIN NOW He had doubled the cape a few odd times and END
BEGIN NOW weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all END
BEGIN NOW those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him END
BEGIN NOW or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him. END
BEGIN NOW So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck END
BEGIN NOW of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the END
BEGIN NOW moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell END
BEGIN NOW remembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. END
BEGIN NOW That was the talk of the town END
BEGIN NOW that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of END
BEGIN NOW 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times), breakers END
BEGIN NOW running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion END
BEGIN NOW petrified with horror. END
BEGIN NOW Then someone said something about the case of the END
BEGIN NOW s. END
BEGIN NOW s. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Cairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an END
BEGIN NOW opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on END
BEGIN NOW deck. END
BEGIN NOW No aid was given. END
BEGIN NOW Her master, the Mona's, said he was afraid his END
BEGIN NOW collision bulkhead would give way. END
BEGIN NOW She had no water, it appears, in her END
BEGIN NOW hold. END
BEGIN NOW At this stage an incident happened. END
BEGIN NOW It having become necessary for him END
BEGIN NOW to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat. END
BEGIN NOW —Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just END
BEGIN NOW gently dropping off into a peaceful doze. END
BEGIN NOW He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, END
BEGIN NOW stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore END
BEGIN NOW due left. END
BEGIN NOW While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who END
BEGIN NOW noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum END
BEGIN NOW sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his END
BEGIN NOW burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, END
BEGIN NOW applying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of END
BEGIN NOW it with a gurgling noise. END
BEGIN NOW The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd END
BEGIN NOW suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the END
BEGIN NOW counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared END
BEGIN NOW to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when END
BEGIN NOW duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and END
BEGIN NOW girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all END
BEGIN NOW radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. END
BEGIN NOW Some person END
BEGIN NOW or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the END
BEGIN NOW cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief END
BEGIN NOW space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently END
BEGIN NOW giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his END
BEGIN NOW bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where END
BEGIN NOW it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. END
BEGIN NOW A hoof scooped anyway for END
BEGIN NOW new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. END
BEGIN NOW Slightly disturbed in his END
BEGIN NOW sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation END
BEGIN NOW stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other END
BEGIN NOW in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the END
BEGIN NOW parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human END
BEGIN NOW probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about END
BEGIN NOW and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms END
BEGIN NOW of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent END
BEGIN NOW form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent END
BEGIN NOW home comforts all his life who came in for a cool Â£ 100 a year at one END
BEGIN NOW time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general END
BEGIN NOW ducks and drakes of. END
BEGIN NOW And there he was at the end of his tether after END
BEGIN NOW having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. END
BEGIN NOW He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when END
BEGIN NOW he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, END
BEGIN NOW however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality. END
BEGIN NOW All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, END
BEGIN NOW coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same END
BEGIN NOW thing. END
BEGIN NOW A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, END
BEGIN NOW the only launch that year. END
BEGIN NOW Right enough the harbours were there only no END
BEGIN NOW ships ever called. END
BEGIN NOW There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently au END
BEGIN NOW fait. END
BEGIN NOW What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only END
BEGIN NOW rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr END
BEGIN NOW Worthington or some name like that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Ask the then captain, he advised END
BEGIN NOW them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day's END
BEGIN NOW work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line. END
BEGIN NOW —Am I right, skipper? END
BEGIN NOW he queried of the sailor, now returning after his END
BEGIN NOW private potation and the rest of his exertions. END
BEGIN NOW That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words END
BEGIN NOW growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other END
BEGIN NOW in seconds or thirds. END
BEGIN NOW Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate END
BEGIN NOW the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the END
BEGIN NOW time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs END
BEGIN NOW and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow in he END
BEGIN NOW rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an END
BEGIN NOW atmosphere of drink into the soirÃ©e, boisterously trolling, like a END
BEGIN NOW veritable son of a seacook: END
BEGIN NOW —The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot's wife's END
BEGIN NOW arse. END
BEGIN NOW O, Johnny Lever! END
BEGIN NOW Johnny Lever, O! END
BEGIN NOW After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene END
BEGIN NOW and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form END
BEGIN NOW provided. END
BEGIN NOW Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to END
BEGIN NOW grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent END
BEGIN NOW the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he END
BEGIN NOW described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on END
BEGIN NOW the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in END
BEGIN NOW large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, END
BEGIN NOW ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of END
BEGIN NOW it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the END
BEGIN NOW nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more END
BEGIN NOW surplus steam in the same vein. END
BEGIN NOW Their conversation accordingly became END
BEGIN NOW general and all agreed that that was a fact. END
BEGIN NOW You could grow any mortal END
BEGIN NOW thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down END
BEGIN NOW there in Navan growing tobacco. END
BEGIN NOW Where would you find anywhere the like END
BEGIN NOW of Irish bacon? END
BEGIN NOW But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no END
BEGIN NOW uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in END
BEGIN NOW store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her END
BEGIN NOW crimes. END
BEGIN NOW There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he END
BEGIN NOW affirmed. END
BEGIN NOW The Boers were the beginning of the end. END
BEGIN NOW Brummagem England was END
BEGIN NOW toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, END
BEGIN NOW which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the END
BEGIN NOW Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped END
BEGIN NOW their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. END
BEGIN NOW His END
BEGIN NOW advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work END
BEGIN NOW for Ireland and live for Ireland. END
BEGIN NOW Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare END
BEGIN NOW a single one of her sons. END
BEGIN NOW Silence all round marked the termination of his finale. END
BEGIN NOW The impervious END
BEGIN NOW navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed. END
BEGIN NOW —Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit END
BEGIN NOW peeved in response to the foregoing truism. END
BEGIN NOW To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper END
BEGIN NOW concurred but nevertheless held to his main view. END
BEGIN NOW —Who's the best troops in the army? END
BEGIN NOW the grizzled old veteran irately END
BEGIN NOW interrogated. END
BEGIN NOW And the best jumpers and racers? END
BEGIN NOW And the best admirals and END
BEGIN NOW generals we've got? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me that. END
BEGIN NOW —The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial END
BEGIN NOW blemishes apart. END
BEGIN NOW —That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. END
BEGIN NOW The Irish catholic END
BEGIN NOW peasant. END
BEGIN NOW He's the backbone of our empire. END
BEGIN NOW You know Jem Mullins? END
BEGIN NOW While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added END
BEGIN NOW he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman END
BEGIN NOW worthy of his salt that served it. END
BEGIN NOW Then they began to have a few END
BEGIN NOW irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing END
BEGIN NOW to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long END
BEGIN NOW as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows. END
BEGIN NOW From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was END
BEGIN NOW rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, END
BEGIN NOW pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was END
BEGIN NOW fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, END
BEGIN NOW unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather END
BEGIN NOW concealed their strength than the opposite. END
BEGIN NOW It was quite on a par with END
BEGIN NOW the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years END
BEGIN NOW the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time END
BEGIN NOW went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could END
BEGIN NOW personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, END
BEGIN NOW equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly END
BEGIN NOW advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even END
BEGIN NOW though poles apart. END
BEGIN NOW Another little interesting point, the amours of END
BEGIN NOW whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish END
BEGIN NOW soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in END
BEGIN NOW fact. END
BEGIN NOW And now, why? END
BEGIN NOW So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee END
BEGIN NOW of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous END
BEGIN NOW invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as END
BEGIN NOW being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was END
BEGIN NOW prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, END
BEGIN NOW the others seeing least of the game. END
BEGIN NOW And as for the lessee or keeper, END
BEGIN NOW who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (B.) couldn't help END
BEGIN NOW feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the END
BEGIN NOW goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have END
BEGIN NOW anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their END
BEGIN NOW felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming END
BEGIN NOW forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like Denis or Peter END
BEGIN NOW Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. END
BEGIN NOW Quite apart from that he disliked END
BEGIN NOW those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, though such END
BEGIN NOW criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape END
BEGIN NOW or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly END
BEGIN NOW remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had END
BEGIN NOW actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his END
BEGIN NOW political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to END
BEGIN NOW any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, END
BEGIN NOW have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words END
BEGIN NOW passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky END
BEGIN NOW mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his END
BEGIN NOW adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging END
BEGIN NOW his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin- END
BEGIN NOW the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the END
BEGIN NOW outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to END
BEGIN NOW the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary END
BEGIN NOW saved his skin on. END
BEGIN NOW In any case that was very ancient history by now and END
BEGIN NOW as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently END
BEGIN NOW outlived his welcome. END
BEGIN NOW He ought to have either died naturally or on the END
BEGIN NOW scaffold high. END
BEGIN NOW Like actresses, always farewell positively last END
BEGIN NOW performance then come up smiling again. END
BEGIN NOW Generous to a fault of course, END
BEGIN NOW temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping END
BEGIN NOW at the bone for the shadow. END
BEGIN NOW So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion END
BEGIN NOW that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d. END
BEGIN NOW in the course of his END
BEGIN NOW perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old END
BEGIN NOW Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. END
BEGIN NOW Then as for the other he END
BEGIN NOW had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen END
BEGIN NOW how he simply but effectually silenced the offender. END
BEGIN NOW —He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the END
BEGIN NOW whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. END
BEGIN NOW He called me a jew and END
BEGIN NOW in a heated fashion offensively. END
BEGIN NOW So I without deviating from plain facts END
BEGIN NOW in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his END
BEGIN NOW family like me though in reality I'm not. END
BEGIN NOW That was one for him. END
BEGIN NOW A soft END
BEGIN NOW answer turns away wrath. END
BEGIN NOW He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone END
BEGIN NOW saw. END
BEGIN NOW Am I not right? END
BEGIN NOW He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at END
BEGIN NOW the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to END
BEGIN NOW glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly. END
BEGIN NOW —Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four END
BEGIN NOW eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other, END
BEGIN NOW secundum carnem. END
BEGIN NOW —Of course, Mr B. END
BEGIN NOW proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of END
BEGIN NOW the question. END
BEGIN NOW It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right END
BEGIN NOW and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though END
BEGIN NOW every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the END
BEGIN NOW government it deserves. END
BEGIN NOW But with a little goodwill all round. END
BEGIN NOW It's all END
BEGIN NOW very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. END
BEGIN NOW I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. END
BEGIN NOW It never reaches END
BEGIN NOW anything or stops anything. END
BEGIN NOW A revolution must come on the due END
BEGIN NOW instalments plan. END
BEGIN NOW It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate END
BEGIN NOW people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, END
BEGIN NOW in the next house so to speak. END
BEGIN NOW —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen END
BEGIN NOW assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was END
BEGIN NOW overwhelmingly right. END
BEGIN NOW And the whole world was full of that sort of END
BEGIN NOW thing. END
BEGIN NOW —You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A hocuspocus of END
BEGIN NOW conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely... END
BEGIN NOW All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad END
BEGIN NOW blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, END
BEGIN NOW erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were END
BEGIN NOW very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of END
BEGIN NOW everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop. END
BEGIN NOW —They accuse, remarked he audibly. END
BEGIN NOW He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as END
BEGIN NOW the others in case they. END
BEGIN NOW —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of END
BEGIN NOW ruining. END
BEGIN NOW Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. END
BEGIN NOW History, would END
BEGIN NOW you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the END
BEGIN NOW inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an END
BEGIN NOW uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, END
BEGIN NOW imported them. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. END
BEGIN NOW They END
BEGIN NOW are practical and are proved to be so. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to indulge in any END
BEGIN NOW because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as END
BEGIN NOW you are. END
BEGIN NOW But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest END
BEGIN NOW spells poverty. END
BEGIN NOW Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead END
BEGIN NOW America. END
BEGIN NOW Turks. END
BEGIN NOW It's in the dogma. END
BEGIN NOW Because if they didn't believe they'd END
BEGIN NOW go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better, at least END
BEGIN NOW so I think. END
BEGIN NOW That's the juggle on which the p.p's raise the wind on false END
BEGIN NOW pretences. END
BEGIN NOW I'm, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as END
BEGIN NOW that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see END
BEGIN NOW everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a END
BEGIN NOW comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in END
BEGIN NOW the neighbourhood of Â£ 300 per annum. END
BEGIN NOW That's the vital issue at stake END
BEGIN NOW and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse END
BEGIN NOW between man and man. END
BEGIN NOW At least that's my idea for what it's worth. END
BEGIN NOW I call END
BEGIN NOW that patriotism. END
BEGIN NOW Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of in our END
BEGIN NOW classical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. END
BEGIN NOW Where you can live well, the END
BEGIN NOW sense is, if you work. END
BEGIN NOW Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this END
BEGIN NOW synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. END
BEGIN NOW He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those END
BEGIN NOW crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours END
BEGIN NOW of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere END
BEGIN NOW beneath or seemed to. END
BEGIN NOW Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or END
BEGIN NOW didn't say the words the voice he heard said, if you work. END
BEGIN NOW —Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work. END
BEGIN NOW The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person END
BEGIN NOW who owned them pro tem. END
BEGIN NOW observed or rather his voice speaking did, all END
BEGIN NOW must work, have to, together. END
BEGIN NOW —I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest END
BEGIN NOW possible sense. END
BEGIN NOW Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the END
BEGIN NOW thing. END
BEGIN NOW Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel END
BEGIN NOW nowadays. END
BEGIN NOW That's work too. END
BEGIN NOW Important work. END
BEGIN NOW After all, from the little I END
BEGIN NOW know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are END
BEGIN NOW entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. END
BEGIN NOW You have every bit END
BEGIN NOW as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the END
BEGIN NOW peasant has. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. END
BEGIN NOW Each is equally important. END
BEGIN NOW —You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may END
BEGIN NOW be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called END
BEGIN NOW Ireland for short. END
BEGIN NOW —I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated. END
BEGIN NOW —But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important END
BEGIN NOW because it belongs to me. END
BEGIN NOW —What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under END
BEGIN NOW some misapprehension. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunately, I didn't catch the END
BEGIN NOW latter portion. END
BEGIN NOW What was it you...? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of END
BEGIN NOW coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: 1170 END
BEGIN NOW —We can't change the country. END
BEGIN NOW Let us change the subject. END
BEGIN NOW At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked END
BEGIN NOW down but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to END
BEGIN NOW put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. END
BEGIN NOW The rebuke of some END
BEGIN NOW kind was clearer than the other part. END
BEGIN NOW Needless to say the fumes of his END
BEGIN NOW recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way END
BEGIN NOW foreign to his sober state. END
BEGIN NOW Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached END
BEGIN NOW the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn't END
BEGIN NOW been familiarised with the right sort of people. END
BEGIN NOW With a touch of fear END
BEGIN NOW for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air END
BEGIN NOW of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the END
BEGIN NOW eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, END
BEGIN NOW failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind END
BEGIN NOW instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the END
BEGIN NOW bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. END
BEGIN NOW For instance END
BEGIN NOW there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, END
BEGIN NOW respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries END
BEGIN NOW among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to END
BEGIN NOW everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in END
BEGIN NOW public a suit of brown paper (a fact). END
BEGIN NOW And then the usual dÃ©nouement END
BEGIN NOW after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot END
BEGIN NOW water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint END
BEGIN NOW to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be END
BEGIN NOW made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, END
BEGIN NOW certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged for END
BEGIN NOW reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. END
BEGIN NOW Briefly, END
BEGIN NOW putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a END
BEGIN NOW deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo END
BEGIN NOW which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house END
BEGIN NOW of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir END
BEGIN NOW apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages END
BEGIN NOW simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected END
BEGIN NOW about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to END
BEGIN NOW morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their END
BEGIN NOW veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as END
BEGIN NOW the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they END
BEGIN NOW thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were END
BEGIN NOW always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of END
BEGIN NOW dress and all the rest of it. END
BEGIN NOW Ladies who like distinctive underclothing END
BEGIN NOW should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider END
BEGIN NOW between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of END
BEGIN NOW impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, END
BEGIN NOW mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety END
BEGIN NOW degrees in the shade not caring a continental. END
BEGIN NOW However, reverting to the END
BEGIN NOW original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way END
BEGIN NOW to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. END
BEGIN NOW Sheer END
BEGIN NOW force of natural genius, that. END
BEGIN NOW With brains, sir. END
BEGIN NOW For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even END
BEGIN NOW to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could END
BEGIN NOW not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad END
BEGIN NOW having in fact let himself in for it. END
BEGIN NOW Still to cultivate the END
BEGIN NOW acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food END
BEGIN NOW for reflection would amply repay any small. END
BEGIN NOW Intellectual stimulation, as END

BEGIN NOW One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: END
BEGIN NOW Return of Parnell. END
BEGIN NOW He bet them what they liked. END
BEGIN NOW A Dublin fusilier was in END

BEGIN NOW Then they would all to a man have gone END
BEGIN NOW down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his END

BEGIN NOW Dead he wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW Simply absconded somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW The coffin they END
BEGIN NOW brought over was full of stones. END
BEGIN NOW He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer END
BEGIN NOW general. END
BEGIN NOW He made a mistake to fight the priests. END
BEGIN NOW And so forth and so on. END
BEGIN NOW All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their END
BEGIN NOW memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and END
BEGIN NOW not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it END
BEGIN NOW was twenty odd years. END
BEGIN NOW Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow END
BEGIN NOW of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly END
BEGIN NOW inadvisable, all things considered. END
BEGIN NOW Something evidently riled them in END
BEGIN NOW his death. END
BEGIN NOW Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when END
BEGIN NOW his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or END
BEGIN NOW whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to END
BEGIN NOW change his boots and clothes-after a wetting when a cold resulted and END
BEGIN NOW failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he END
BEGIN NOW eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at END
BEGIN NOW an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken END
BEGIN NOW out of their hands. END
BEGIN NOW Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements END
BEGIN NOW even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which END
BEGIN NOW were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his END
BEGIN NOW starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the END
BEGIN NOW remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of END
BEGIN NOW possibility. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader END
BEGIN NOW of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or END
BEGIN NOW at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas END
BEGIN NOW Messrs So and So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former END
BEGIN NOW man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and END
BEGIN NOW far between. END
BEGIN NOW It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, END
BEGIN NOW and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual END
BEGIN NOW mudslinging. END
BEGIN NOW And the identical same with murderers. END
BEGIN NOW You had to come END
BEGIN NOW back. END
BEGIN NOW That haunting sense kind of drew you. END
BEGIN NOW To show the understudy in END
BEGIN NOW the title rÃ´le how to. END
BEGIN NOW He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when END
BEGIN NOW they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a END
BEGIN NOW privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his END
BEGIN NOW silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he END
BEGIN NOW undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little END
BEGIN NOW misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what's bred in the END
BEGIN NOW bone. END
BEGIN NOW Still as regards return. END
BEGIN NOW You were a lucky dog if they didn't set END
BEGIN NOW the terrier at you directly you got back. END
BEGIN NOW Then a lot of shillyshally END
BEGIN NOW usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. END
BEGIN NOW And then, number END
BEGIN NOW one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your END
BEGIN NOW credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles END
BEGIN NOW Tichborne, Bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, END
BEGIN NOW the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a END
BEGIN NOW tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very END
BEGIN NOW easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, END
BEGIN NOW when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, my name is So and So or some such commonplace remark. END
BEGIN NOW A more END
BEGIN NOW prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the END
BEGIN NOW distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to END
BEGIN NOW sound the lie of the land first. END
BEGIN NOW —That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor END
BEGIN NOW commented. END
BEGIN NOW She put the first nail in his coffin. END
BEGIN NOW —Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk Henry END
BEGIN NOW Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. END
BEGIN NOW She loosened many a man's thighs. END
BEGIN NOW I seen her picture in a barber's. END
BEGIN NOW The husband was a captain or an END
BEGIN NOW officer. END
BEGIN NOW —Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one. END
BEGIN NOW This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair END
BEGIN NOW amount of laughter among his entourage. END
BEGIN NOW As regards Bloom he, without the END
BEGIN NOW faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door END
BEGIN NOW and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary END
BEGIN NOW interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made END
BEGIN NOW public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full END
BEGIN NOW of sweet nothings. END
BEGIN NOW First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened END
BEGIN NOW and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to END
BEGIN NOW a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering END
BEGIN NOW blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, END
BEGIN NOW who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was END
BEGIN NOW public property all along though not to anything like the sensational END
BEGIN NOW extent that it subsequently blossomed into. END
BEGIN NOW Since their names were END
BEGIN NOW coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the END
BEGIN NOW particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the END
BEGIN NOW housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came END
BEGIN NOW out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed END
BEGIN NOW court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses END
BEGIN NOW swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in END
BEGIN NOW the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance END
BEGIN NOW of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same END
BEGIN NOW fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply END
BEGIN NOW coined shoals of money out of. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas the simple fact of the case was END
BEGIN NOW it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with END
BEGIN NOW nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man END
BEGIN NOW arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim END
BEGIN NOW to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask END
BEGIN NOW in the loved one's smiles. END
BEGIN NOW The eternal question of the life connubial, END
BEGIN NOW needless to say, cropped up. END
BEGIN NOW Can real love, supposing there happens to END
BEGIN NOW be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? END
BEGIN NOW Poser. END
BEGIN NOW Though END
BEGIN NOW it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with END
BEGIN NOW affection, carried away by a wave of folly. END
BEGIN NOW A magnificent specimen of END
BEGIN NOW manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as END
BEGIN NOW compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the END
BEGIN NOW usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the END
BEGIN NOW light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable END
BEGIN NOW doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own END
BEGIN NOW peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly END
BEGIN NOW likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the END
BEGIN NOW priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch END
BEGIN NOW adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman END
BEGIN NOW service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on END
BEGIN NOW their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, END
BEGIN NOW very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of END
BEGIN NOW fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. END
BEGIN NOW Looking END
BEGIN NOW back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of END
BEGIN NOW dream. END
BEGIN NOW And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it END
BEGIN NOW went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved END
BEGIN NOW with the times. END
BEGIN NOW Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he END
BEGIN NOW had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow END
BEGIN NOW since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. END
BEGIN NOW North or END
BEGIN NOW south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and END
BEGIN NOW simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the END
BEGIN NOW very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that END
BEGIN NOW wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting END
BEGIN NOW every shred of decency to the winds. END
BEGIN NOW —Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, about blood and the sun. END
BEGIN NOW And, if I don't greatly mistake she END
BEGIN NOW was Spanish too. END
BEGIN NOW —The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or END
BEGIN NOW other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and END
BEGIN NOW the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and END
BEGIN NOW so many. END
BEGIN NOW —Was she? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any END
BEGIN NOW means, I never heard that rumour before. END
BEGIN NOW Possible, especially there, it END
BEGIN NOW was as she lived there. END
BEGIN NOW So, Spain. END
BEGIN NOW Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by END
BEGIN NOW the by of that Cap l street library book out of date, he took out his END
BEGIN NOW pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly END
BEGIN NOW finally he. END
BEGIN NOW —Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded END
BEGIN NOW photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large END
BEGIN NOW sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she END
BEGIN NOW was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously END
BEGIN NOW low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than END
BEGIN NOW vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing END
BEGIN NOW near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old END
BEGIN NOW Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. END
BEGIN NOW Her END
BEGIN NOW (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about END
BEGIN NOW something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's END
BEGIN NOW premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic END
BEGIN NOW execution. END
BEGIN NOW —Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom END
BEGIN NOW indicated. END
BEGIN NOW Taken a few years since. END
BEGIN NOW In or about ninety six. END
BEGIN NOW Very like END
BEGIN NOW her then. END
BEGIN NOW Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his END
BEGIN NOW 1440 legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of END
BEGIN NOW Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency END
BEGIN NOW as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years END
BEGIN NOW numbered barely sweet sixteen. END
BEGIN NOW As for the face it was a speaking END
BEGIN NOW likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which END
BEGIN NOW came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the END
BEGIN NOW best advantage in that getup. END
BEGIN NOW She could without difficulty, he said, END
BEGIN NOW have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of END
BEGIN NOW the. END
BEGIN NOW He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female END
BEGIN NOW form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later END
BEGIN NOW than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly END
BEGIN NOW developed as works of art, in the National Museum. END
BEGIN NOW Marble could give the END
BEGIN NOW original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, END
BEGIN NOW puritanisme, it does though Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors END
BEGIN NOW (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas no photo could because it simply END
BEGIN NOW wasn't art in a word. END
BEGIN NOW The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good END
BEGIN NOW example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for END
BEGIN NOW itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for END
BEGIN NOW himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the END
BEGIN NOW camera could not at all do justice to. END
BEGIN NOW But it was scarcely professional END
BEGIN NOW etiquette so. END
BEGIN NOW Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet END
BEGIN NOW wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. END
BEGIN NOW And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind END
BEGIN NOW of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. END
BEGIN NOW Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased END
BEGIN NOW by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away END
BEGIN NOW thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's END
BEGIN NOW possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. END
BEGIN NOW In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of END
BEGIN NOW linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose she was gone when he? END
BEGIN NOW I looked for the lamp which she told END
BEGIN NOW me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he END
BEGIN NOW then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about END
BEGIN NOW Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down END
BEGIN NOW sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies END
BEGIN NOW to Lindley Murray. END
BEGIN NOW The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, END
BEGIN NOW distinguÃ© and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the END
BEGIN NOW bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would. END
BEGIN NOW Besides END
BEGIN NOW he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though END
BEGIN NOW at the moment she was distinctly stouter. END
BEGIN NOW And why not? END
BEGIN NOW An awful lot of END
BEGIN NOW makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur END
BEGIN NOW with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial END
BEGIN NOW tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage END
BEGIN NOW favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole END
BEGIN NOW business. END
BEGIN NOW How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up END
BEGIN NOW between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was END
BEGIN NOW told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and END
BEGIN NOW compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly END
BEGIN NOW cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and END
BEGIN NOW relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course END
BEGIN NOW intimate. END
BEGIN NOW Then the decree nisi and the King's proctor tries to show END
BEGIN NOW cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. END
BEGIN NOW But as END
BEGIN NOW for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one END
BEGIN NOW another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till END
BEGIN NOW the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for END
BEGIN NOW the party wronged in due course. END
BEGIN NOW He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being END
BEGIN NOW close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on END
BEGIN NOW the historic fracas when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to END
BEGIN NOW his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, END
BEGIN NOW (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly END
BEGIN NOW even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the END
BEGIN NOW Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by END
BEGIN NOW appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or END
BEGIN NOW something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the END
BEGIN NOW facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging END
BEGIN NOW occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. END
BEGIN NOW Though END
BEGIN NOW palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though END
BEGIN NOW carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went END
BEGIN NOW a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast END
BEGIN NOW discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a END
BEGIN NOW pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. END
BEGIN NOW As those were END
BEGIN NOW particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a END
BEGIN NOW minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of END
BEGIN NOW course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, END
BEGIN NOW fortunately not of a grave character. END
BEGIN NOW His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was END
BEGIN NOW inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was END
BEGIN NOW the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence END

BEGIN NOW —At what o'clock did you dine? END
BEGIN NOW he questioned of the slim form and tired END
BEGIN NOW though unwrinkled face. END
BEGIN NOW —Some time yesterday, Stephen said. END
BEGIN NOW —Yesterday! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow END
BEGIN NOW Friday. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you mean it's after twelve! END
BEGIN NOW —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself. END
BEGIN NOW Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. END
BEGIN NOW Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there END
BEGIN NOW somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the END
BEGIN NOW one train of thought. END
BEGIN NOW At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some END
BEGIN NOW score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to END
BEGIN NOW parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in END
BEGIN NOW retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a END
BEGIN NOW sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. END
BEGIN NOW For instance when the END

BEGIN NOW people's mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper END
BEGIN NOW or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't END

BEGIN NOW thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern END
BEGIN NOW opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was END
BEGIN NOW subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step END
BEGIN NOW farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time END
BEGIN NOW inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly END
BEGIN NOW resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our END
BEGIN NOW friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, END
BEGIN NOW though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of END
BEGIN NOW mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him END
BEGIN NOW (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics END
BEGIN NOW themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties END
BEGIN NOW invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity END
BEGIN NOW and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on END
BEGIN NOW fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it END
BEGIN NOW was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. END
BEGIN NOW The crux was it was END
BEGIN NOW a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue END
BEGIN NOW (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash END
BEGIN NOW altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed END
BEGIN NOW unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or END
BEGIN NOW the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he END
BEGIN NOW very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. END
BEGIN NOW On the other END
BEGIN NOW hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or END
BEGIN NOW Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of END
BEGIN NOW the two alternatives. END
BEGIN NOW Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him END
BEGIN NOW to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. END
BEGIN NOW His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over END
BEGIN NOW effusive but it grew on him someway. END
BEGIN NOW For one thing he mightn't what you END
BEGIN NOW call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he END
BEGIN NOW didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did END
BEGIN NOW entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal END
BEGIN NOW pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some END
BEGIN NOW wardrobe, if found suitable. END
BEGIN NOW At all events he wound up by concluding, END
BEGIN NOW eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a END
BEGIN NOW shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat END
BEGIN NOW doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as END
BEGIN NOW a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm END
BEGIN NOW in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. END
BEGIN NOW A END
BEGIN NOW move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in END
BEGIN NOW question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any END
BEGIN NOW particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown END
BEGIN NOW and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties END
BEGIN NOW where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to END
BEGIN NOW that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, END
BEGIN NOW alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber END
BEGIN NOW revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the END
BEGIN NOW marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms END
BEGIN NOW betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large END
BEGIN NOW potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who END
BEGIN NOW he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra END
BEGIN NOW remarks passim. END
BEGIN NOW At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle END
BEGIN NOW repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. END
BEGIN NOW People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled END
BEGIN NOW them was a bite from a sheep. END
BEGIN NOW The most vulnerable point too of tender END
BEGIN NOW Achilles. END
BEGIN NOW Your god was a jew. END
BEGIN NOW Because mostly they appeared to imagine he END
BEGIN NOW came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo. END
BEGIN NOW —I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while END
BEGIN NOW prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come END
BEGIN NOW home with me and talk things over. END
BEGIN NOW My diggings are quite close in the END
BEGIN NOW vicinity. END
BEGIN NOW You can't drink that stuff. END
BEGIN NOW Do you like cocoa? END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I'll just END
BEGIN NOW pay this lot. END
BEGIN NOW The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain END
BEGIN NOW sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper END
BEGIN NOW of the shanty who didn't seem to. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that END
BEGIN NOW Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain, END
BEGIN NOW education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, END
BEGIN NOW up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed END
BEGIN NOW with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian END
BEGIN NOW with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, END
BEGIN NOW no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the END
BEGIN NOW housetops about it, and a slice of luck. END
BEGIN NOW An opening was all was wanted. END
BEGIN NOW Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his END
BEGIN NOW hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as END
BEGIN NOW well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of END
BEGIN NOW that particular red herring just to. END
BEGIN NOW The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former END
BEGIN NOW viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association END
BEGIN NOW dinner in London somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this END
BEGIN NOW thrilling announcement. END
BEGIN NOW Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared END
BEGIN NOW to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell END
BEGIN NOW had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. END
BEGIN NOW To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. END
BEGIN NOW —Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner END
BEGIN NOW put in, manifesting some natural impatience. END
BEGIN NOW —And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed. END
BEGIN NOW The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles END
BEGIN NOW which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. END
BEGIN NOW —Are you bad in the eyes? END
BEGIN NOW the sympathetic personage like the townclerk END
BEGIN NOW queried. END
BEGIN NOW —Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a END
BEGIN NOW bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen END
BEGIN NOW portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. END
BEGIN NOW Sand in the Red Sea done that. END
BEGIN NOW One time I could read a book in the dark, END
BEGIN NOW manner of speaking. END
BEGIN NOW The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite END
BEGIN NOW and Red as a Rose is She. END
BEGIN NOW Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, END
BEGIN NOW found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a END
BEGIN NOW hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time END
BEGIN NOW (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied END
BEGIN NOW loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched END
BEGIN NOW him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were END
BEGIN NOW sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, END
BEGIN NOW that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial END
BEGIN NOW remark. END
BEGIN NOW To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first END
BEGIN NOW to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first END
BEGIN NOW and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for END
BEGIN NOW the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine END
BEGIN NOW host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were END
BEGIN NOW not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a END
BEGIN NOW grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four END
BEGIN NOW coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously END
BEGIN NOW spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in END
BEGIN NOW unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well END
BEGIN NOW worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. END
BEGIN NOW —Come, he counselled to close the sÃ©ance. END
BEGIN NOW Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the END
BEGIN NOW shelter or shanty together and the Ã©lite society of oilskin and company END
BEGIN NOW whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far END
BEGIN NOW niente. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, END
BEGIN NOW paused at the, for a moment, the door. END
BEGIN NOW —One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the END
BEGIN NOW moment. END
BEGIN NOW Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside END
BEGIN NOW down, on the tables in cafÃ©s. END
BEGIN NOW To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom END
BEGIN NOW replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off: END
BEGIN NOW —To sweep the floor in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same END
BEGIN NOW time apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the END
BEGIN NOW bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit END
BEGIN NOW weak on his pins. END
BEGIN NOW —It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a END
BEGIN NOW moment. END
BEGIN NOW The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW It's not far. END
BEGIN NOW Lean on me. END
BEGIN NOW Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on END
BEGIN NOW accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW —Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind END
BEGIN NOW of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. END
BEGIN NOW where the END
BEGIN NOW municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and END
BEGIN NOW purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of END
BEGIN NOW fresh fields and pastures new. END
BEGIN NOW And apropos of coffin of stones the END
BEGIN NOW analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the END
BEGIN NOW part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the END
BEGIN NOW time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the END
BEGIN NOW selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. END
BEGIN NOW So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made END
BEGIN NOW tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. END
BEGIN NOW Wagnerian music, though END
BEGIN NOW confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to END
BEGIN NOW follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, END
BEGIN NOW Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart's Twelfth Mass he END
BEGIN NOW simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of END
BEGIN NOW first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a END
BEGIN NOW cocked hat. END
BEGIN NOW He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic END
BEGIN NOW church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as END
BEGIN NOW those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and i will live thy END
BEGIN NOW protestant to be. END
BEGIN NOW He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's END
BEGIN NOW Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his END
BEGIN NOW wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might END
BEGIN NOW safely say, greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others END
BEGIN NOW totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church in upper Gardiner END
BEGIN NOW street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with END
BEGIN NOW virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. END
BEGIN NOW There was the unanimous opinion that END
BEGIN NOW there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of END
BEGIN NOW worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced END
BEGIN NOW desire for an encore. END
BEGIN NOW On the whole though favouring preferably light END
BEGIN NOW opera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line, he END
BEGIN NOW had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe END
BEGIN NOW classical school such as Mendelssohn. END
BEGIN NOW And talking of that, taking it for END
BEGIN NOW granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par END
BEGIN NOW excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he END
BEGIN NOW had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege END
BEGIN NOW he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung END
BEGIN NOW to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others END
BEGIN NOW take a back seat. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he END
BEGIN NOW didn't sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at END
BEGIN NOW least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in END
BEGIN NOW Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, END
BEGIN NOW Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold END
BEGIN NOW Dolmetsch, whom B. END
BEGIN NOW did not quite recall though the name certainly END
BEGIN NOW sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their END
BEGIN NOW dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he END
BEGIN NOW said, in the Queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one END
BEGIN NOW Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull. END
BEGIN NOW On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond END
BEGIN NOW the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, END
BEGIN NOW brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not END
BEGIN NOW perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive END
BEGIN NOW guineas and John Bull. END
BEGIN NOW He inquired if it was John Bull the political END
BEGIN NOW celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a END
BEGIN NOW striking coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, END
BEGIN NOW who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's sleeve END
BEGIN NOW gently, jocosely remarking: END
BEGIN NOW —Our lives are in peril tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Beware of the steamroller. END
BEGIN NOW They thereupon stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth END
BEGIN NOW anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite END
BEGIN NOW near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh END
BEGIN NOW because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a END
BEGIN NOW taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the END
BEGIN NOW lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW But such END
BEGIN NOW a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he END
BEGIN NOW wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency END
BEGIN NOW that might crop up. END
BEGIN NOW He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a END
BEGIN NOW horse, without a second care in the world. END
BEGIN NOW But even a dog, he reflected, END
BEGIN NOW take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy END
BEGIN NOW horror to face. END
BEGIN NOW But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was END
BEGIN NOW built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes END
BEGIN NOW into potheen in his hump. END
BEGIN NOW Nine tenths of them all could be caged or END
BEGIN NOW trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. END
BEGIN NOW Whale with a END
BEGIN NOW harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the END
BEGIN NOW joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. END
BEGIN NOW These timely END
BEGIN NOW reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat END
BEGIN NOW distracted from Stephen's words while the ship of the street was END
BEGIN NOW manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old. END
BEGIN NOW —What's this I was saying? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, yes! END
BEGIN NOW My wife, he intimated, plunging in END
BEGIN NOW medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your END
BEGIN NOW acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, END
BEGIN NOW image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome END
BEGIN NOW blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as END
BEGIN NOW he was perhaps not that way built. END
BEGIN NOW Still, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected, it END
BEGIN NOW opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish END
BEGIN NOW industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general. END
BEGIN NOW Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End END
BEGIN NOW by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come END
BEGIN NOW from. END
BEGIN NOW Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the END
BEGIN NOW clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which END
BEGIN NOW boggled Bloom a bit: END
BEGIN NOW Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten. END
BEGIN NOW These opening bars he sang and translated extempore. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, nodding, END
BEGIN NOW said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which END
BEGIN NOW he did. END
BEGIN NOW A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, END
BEGIN NOW which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, END
BEGIN NOW if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production END
BEGIN NOW such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, END
BEGIN NOW command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for END
BEGIN NOW its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrÃ©e into fashionable END
BEGIN NOW houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large END
BEGIN NOW way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. END
BEGIN NOW A. END
BEGIN NOW (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more END
BEGIN NOW influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct END
BEGIN NOW success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the END
BEGIN NOW purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to END
BEGIN NOW so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a END
BEGIN NOW youthful tyro in—society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a END
BEGIN NOW little thing like that could militate against you. END
BEGIN NOW It was in fact only a END
BEGIN NOW matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their END
BEGIN NOW musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the END
BEGIN NOW Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes END
BEGIN NOW of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, END
BEGIN NOW cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without END
BEGIN NOW giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could END
BEGIN NOW easily have. END
BEGIN NOW Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument END
BEGIN NOW by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. END
BEGIN NOW Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need END
BEGIN NOW necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy END
BEGIN NOW space of time. END
BEGIN NOW But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or END
BEGIN NOW nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his END
BEGIN NOW dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be END
BEGIN NOW handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original END
BEGIN NOW music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have END
BEGIN NOW a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical END
BEGIN NOW world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a END
BEGIN NOW confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus END
BEGIN NOW omne. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his END
BEGIN NOW hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a END
BEGIN NOW high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure END
BEGIN NOW and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King END
BEGIN NOW street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him END
BEGIN NOW upstairs, so to speak, a big if, however, with some impetus of the END
BEGIN NOW goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often END
BEGIN NOW tripped-up a too much fÃªted prince of good fellows. END
BEGIN NOW And it need not END
BEGIN NOW detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would END
BEGIN NOW have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when END
BEGIN NOW desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or END
BEGIN NOW containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself END
BEGIN NOW alone. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason END
BEGIN NOW why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat END
BEGIN NOW of any sort, hung on to him at all. END
BEGIN NOW The horse was just then. END
BEGIN NOW And later on at a propitious opportunity he END
BEGIN NOW purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on END
BEGIN NOW the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his END
BEGIN NOW connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was END
BEGIN NOW prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious END
BEGIN NOW pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it END
BEGIN NOW which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of END
BEGIN NOW a person's character, no pun intended. END
BEGIN NOW The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, END
BEGIN NOW rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on END
BEGIN NOW the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking END
BEGIN NOW globes of turds. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly three times, one after another, from a full END
BEGIN NOW crupper he mired. END
BEGIN NOW And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had END
BEGIN NOW ended, patient in his scythed car. END
BEGIN NOW Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed END
BEGIN NOW through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping END
BEGIN NOW over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, END
BEGIN NOW Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad. END
BEGIN NOW Und alle Schiffe brÃ¼cken. END
BEGIN NOW The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely END
BEGIN NOW watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one END
BEGIN NOW full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father END
BEGIN NOW Maher. END
BEGIN NOW As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing END
BEGIN NOW their tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about END
BEGIN NOW sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of END
BEGIN NOW the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man END
BEGIN NOW in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who END
BEGIN NOW in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat END
BEGIN NOW in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their END
BEGIN NOW lowbacked car. END
BEGIN NOW [ 17 ] END
BEGIN NOW What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning? END
BEGIN NOW Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they END
BEGIN NOW followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and END
BEGIN NOW Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, END
BEGIN NOW Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of END
BEGIN NOW Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing END
BEGIN NOW right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. END
BEGIN NOW Approaching, END
BEGIN NOW disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before END
BEGIN NOW George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than END
BEGIN NOW the arc which it subtends. END
BEGIN NOW Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? END
BEGIN NOW Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, END
BEGIN NOW prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and END
BEGIN NOW glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed END
BEGIN NOW corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, END
BEGIN NOW ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, END
BEGIN NOW the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the END
BEGIN NOW presabbath, Stephen's collapse. END
BEGIN NOW Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective END
BEGIN NOW like and unlike reactions to experience? END
BEGIN NOW Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to END
BEGIN NOW plastic or pictorial. END
BEGIN NOW Both preferred a continental to an insular manner END
BEGIN NOW of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. END
BEGIN NOW Both END
BEGIN NOW indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of END
BEGIN NOW heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox END
BEGIN NOW religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. END
BEGIN NOW Both admitted the END
BEGIN NOW alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual END
BEGIN NOW magnetism. END
BEGIN NOW Were their views on some points divergent? END
BEGIN NOW Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary END
BEGIN NOW and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on END
BEGIN NOW the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom END
BEGIN NOW assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved END
BEGIN NOW in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to END
BEGIN NOW christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, END
BEGIN NOW son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of END
BEGIN NOW Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (â€ END
BEGIN NOW 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and END
BEGIN NOW interred at Rossnaree. END
BEGIN NOW The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric END
BEGIN NOW inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of END
BEGIN NOW adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and END
BEGIN NOW the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen END
BEGIN NOW attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both END
BEGIN NOW from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first END
BEGIN NOW no bigger than a woman's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? END
BEGIN NOW The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining END
BEGIN NOW paraheliotropic trees. END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in END
BEGIN NOW the past? END
BEGIN NOW In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public END
BEGIN NOW thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's END
BEGIN NOW corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. END
BEGIN NOW In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall END
BEGIN NOW between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of END
BEGIN NOW Uppercross. END
BEGIN NOW In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and END
BEGIN NOW prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class END

BEGIN NOW In 1888 frequently with major Brian END
BEGIN NOW Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on END
BEGIN NOW the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. END
BEGIN NOW Once in 1892 and once END
BEGIN NOW in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour END
BEGIN NOW of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west. END
BEGIN NOW What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, END
BEGIN NOW 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at END
BEGIN NOW their destination? END
BEGIN NOW He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual END
BEGIN NOW development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction END
BEGIN NOW of the converse domain of interindividual relations. END
BEGIN NOW As in what ways? END
BEGIN NOW From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: END
BEGIN NOW existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence END
BEGIN NOW to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. END
BEGIN NOW What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination? END
BEGIN NOW At the housesteps of the 4th Of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number END
BEGIN NOW 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket END
BEGIN NOW of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. END
BEGIN NOW Was it there? END
BEGIN NOW It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on END
BEGIN NOW the day but one preceding. END
BEGIN NOW Why was he doubly irritated? END
BEGIN NOW Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded END
BEGIN NOW himself twice not to forget. END
BEGIN NOW What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly END
BEGIN NOW (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple? END
BEGIN NOW To enter or not to enter. END
BEGIN NOW To knock or not to knock. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's decision? END
BEGIN NOW A stratagem. END
BEGIN NOW Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the END
BEGIN NOW area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the END
BEGIN NOW lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its END
BEGIN NOW length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches END
BEGIN NOW of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by END
BEGIN NOW separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for END
BEGIN NOW the impact of the fall. END
BEGIN NOW Did he fall? END
BEGIN NOW By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in END
BEGIN NOW avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for END
BEGIN NOW periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, END
BEGIN NOW pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast END

BEGIN NOW hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, END
BEGIN NOW dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV. END
BEGIN NOW Did he rise uninjured by concussion? END
BEGIN NOW Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by END
BEGIN NOW the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force END
BEGIN NOW at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at END
BEGIN NOW its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the END
BEGIN NOW subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free END
BEGIN NOW inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock, lit a high flame which, END
BEGIN NOW by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a END
BEGIN NOW portable candle. END
BEGIN NOW What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive? END
BEGIN NOW Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent END
BEGIN NOW kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a END
BEGIN NOW candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man END
BEGIN NOW leaving the kitchen holding a candle. END
BEGIN NOW Did the man reappear elsewhere? END
BEGIN NOW After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible END
BEGIN NOW through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the END
BEGIN NOW halldoor. END
BEGIN NOW The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. END
BEGIN NOW In the open space END
BEGIN NOW of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. END
BEGIN NOW Did Stephen obey his sign? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed END
BEGIN NOW softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted END
BEGIN NOW candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down END
BEGIN NOW a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's END
BEGIN NOW house. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom do? END
BEGIN NOW He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its END
BEGIN NOW flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for END
BEGIN NOW Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when END
BEGIN NOW necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid END
BEGIN NOW resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of END
BEGIN NOW best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs END
BEGIN NOW Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting END
BEGIN NOW points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the END
BEGIN NOW potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and END
BEGIN NOW hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. END
BEGIN NOW Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think? END
BEGIN NOW Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, END
BEGIN NOW had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the END
BEGIN NOW college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the END
BEGIN NOW county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room END
BEGIN NOW of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of END

BEGIN NOW his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra. END
BEGIN NOW What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from END
BEGIN NOW the fire towards the opposite wall? END
BEGIN NOW Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, END
BEGIN NOW stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the END
BEGIN NOW chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs END
BEGIN NOW folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of END
BEGIN NOW ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual END
BEGIN NOW position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer END
BEGIN NOW extremities and the third at their point of junction. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom see on the range? END
BEGIN NOW On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left END
BEGIN NOW (larger) hob a black iron kettle. END
BEGIN NOW What did Bloom do at the range? END
BEGIN NOW He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron END
BEGIN NOW kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to END
BEGIN NOW let it flow. END
BEGIN NOW Did it flow? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of END

BEGIN NOW their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr END
BEGIN NOW Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another END
BEGIN NOW section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. END
BEGIN NOW What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, END
BEGIN NOW returning to the range, admire? END
BEGIN NOW Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in END
BEGIN NOW seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's END
BEGIN NOW projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific END
BEGIN NOW exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface END
BEGIN NOW particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence END
BEGIN NOW of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic END
BEGIN NOW quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: END
BEGIN NOW its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar END
BEGIN NOW icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: END
BEGIN NOW its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its END
BEGIN NOW indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region END
BEGIN NOW below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability END
BEGIN NOW of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve END
BEGIN NOW and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons END
BEGIN NOW of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and END
BEGIN NOW islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and END
BEGIN NOW downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and END
BEGIN NOW volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: END
BEGIN NOW its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: END
BEGIN NOW its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and END
BEGIN NOW confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic END
BEGIN NOW currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence END
BEGIN NOW in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, END
BEGIN NOW freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, END
BEGIN NOW cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: END
BEGIN NOW its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and END
BEGIN NOW latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and END
BEGIN NOW exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, END
BEGIN NOW saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its END
BEGIN NOW composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part END
BEGIN NOW of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead END
BEGIN NOW Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate END
BEGIN NOW dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst END
BEGIN NOW and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and END
BEGIN NOW paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, END
BEGIN NOW hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and END
BEGIN NOW bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and END
BEGIN NOW archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and END
BEGIN NOW arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility END
BEGIN NOW in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power END
BEGIN NOW stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, END
BEGIN NOW rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality END
BEGIN NOW derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to END
BEGIN NOW level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), END
BEGIN NOW numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its END
BEGIN NOW ubiquity as constituting 90 percent of the human body: the noxiousness END
BEGIN NOW of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded END
BEGIN NOW flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon. END
BEGIN NOW Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he END
BEGIN NOW return to the stillflowing tap? END
BEGIN NOW To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of END
BEGIN NOW Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought END
BEGIN NOW thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh END
BEGIN NOW cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a END
BEGIN NOW long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. END
BEGIN NOW What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer? END
BEGIN NOW That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by END
BEGIN NOW submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month END
BEGIN NOW of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of END
BEGIN NOW glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. END
BEGIN NOW What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and END
BEGIN NOW prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a END
BEGIN NOW preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with END
BEGIN NOW rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region END
BEGIN NOW in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most END
BEGIN NOW sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot? END
BEGIN NOW The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. END
BEGIN NOW What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? END
BEGIN NOW Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric END
BEGIN NOW energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the END
BEGIN NOW lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. END
BEGIN NOW Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? END
BEGIN NOW Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and END
BEGIN NOW recuperation. END
BEGIN NOW What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the END
BEGIN NOW agency of fire? END
BEGIN NOW The phenomenon of ebullition. END
BEGIN NOW Fanned by a constant updraught of END
BEGIN NOW ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was END
BEGIN NOW communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral END
BEGIN NOW masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the END
BEGIN NOW foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn END
BEGIN NOW derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat END
BEGIN NOW (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous END
BEGIN NOW ether. END
BEGIN NOW Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, END
BEGIN NOW was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of END
BEGIN NOW calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated END
BEGIN NOW through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part END
BEGIN NOW reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the END
BEGIN NOW temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in END
BEGIN NOW temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal END
BEGIN NOW units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees END
BEGIN NOW Fahrenheit. END
BEGIN NOW What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? END
BEGIN NOW A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at END
BEGIN NOW both sides simultaneously. END
BEGIN NOW For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled? END
BEGIN NOW To shave himself. END
BEGIN NOW What advantages attended shaving by night? END
BEGIN NOW A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from END
BEGIN NOW shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly END
BEGIN NOW encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: END
BEGIN NOW quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when END
BEGIN NOW awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and END
BEGIN NOW perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper END
BEGIN NOW read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a END
BEGIN NOW shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might END
BEGIN NOW cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with END
BEGIN NOW precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done. END
BEGIN NOW Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise? END
BEGIN NOW Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine END
BEGIN NOW feminine passive active hand. END
BEGIN NOW What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting END
BEGIN NOW influence? END
BEGIN NOW The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human END
BEGIN NOW blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their END
BEGIN NOW natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic END
BEGIN NOW surgery. END
BEGIN NOW What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the END
BEGIN NOW kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal END
BEGIN NOW breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a END
BEGIN NOW moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white END
BEGIN NOW goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly END
BEGIN NOW copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. END
BEGIN NOW On the middle shelf a END
BEGIN NOW chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four END
BEGIN NOW conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of END
BEGIN NOW Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and END
BEGIN NOW containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and END
BEGIN NOW Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue END
BEGIN NOW paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's END
BEGIN NOW choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical END
BEGIN NOW canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, END
BEGIN NOW the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with END
BEGIN NOW augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, END
BEGIN NOW a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured END
BEGIN NOW adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and END
BEGIN NOW semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total END
BEGIN NOW quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish END
BEGIN NOW containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. END
BEGIN NOW On the upper shelf a battery of END
BEGIN NOW jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences. END
BEGIN NOW What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? END
BEGIN NOW Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, END
BEGIN NOW numbered 8 87, 88 6. END
BEGIN NOW What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow? END
BEGIN NOW Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, END
BEGIN NOW preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official END
BEGIN NOW and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, END
BEGIN NOW late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, END
BEGIN NOW been received by him? END
BEGIN NOW In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain END

BEGIN NOW Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick END
BEGIN NOW M. END
BEGIN NOW (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and END
BEGIN NOW restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and END
BEGIN NOW National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently END
BEGIN NOW thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the END
BEGIN NOW Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of END
BEGIN NOW inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the END
BEGIN NOW secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction. END
BEGIN NOW What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations? END
BEGIN NOW The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event END
BEGIN NOW followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the END
BEGIN NOW electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by END
BEGIN NOW failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding END
BEGIN NOW originally from a successful interpretation. END
BEGIN NOW His mood? END
BEGIN NOW He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he END
BEGIN NOW was satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW What satisfied him? END
BEGIN NOW To have sustained no positive loss. END
BEGIN NOW To have brought a positive gain to END
BEGIN NOW others. END
BEGIN NOW Light to the gentiles. END
BEGIN NOW How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? END
BEGIN NOW He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's END
BEGIN NOW soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed END
BEGIN NOW on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the END
BEGIN NOW prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity END
BEGIN NOW prescribed. END
BEGIN NOW What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his END
BEGIN NOW guest? END
BEGIN NOW Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation END
BEGIN NOW Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he END
BEGIN NOW substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served END
BEGIN NOW extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the END
BEGIN NOW viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion END
BEGIN NOW (Molly). END
BEGIN NOW Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of END
BEGIN NOW hospitality? END
BEGIN NOW His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted END
BEGIN NOW them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, END
BEGIN NOW the creature cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, END
BEGIN NOW reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to END
BEGIN NOW complete the act begun? END
BEGIN NOW The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right END
BEGIN NOW side of his guest's jacket. END
BEGIN NOW A gift to his guest of one of the four END
BEGIN NOW lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable END
BEGIN NOW condition. END
BEGIN NOW Who drank more quickly? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, END
BEGIN NOW from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady END
BEGIN NOW flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to END
BEGIN NOW two, nine to three. END
BEGIN NOW What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? END
BEGIN NOW Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was END
BEGIN NOW engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from END
BEGIN NOW literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had END
BEGIN NOW applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the END
BEGIN NOW solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life. END
BEGIN NOW Had he found their solution? END
BEGIN NOW In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, END
BEGIN NOW aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, END
BEGIN NOW the answers not bearing in all points. END
BEGIN NOW What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, END
BEGIN NOW potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering END
BEGIN NOW of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the END
BEGIN NOW Shamrock, a weekly newspaper? END

BEGIN NOW you'll find room?. END
BEGIN NOW If you so condescend Then please place at the end The END
BEGIN NOW name of yours truly, L. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom. END
BEGIN NOW Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? END
BEGIN NOW Name, age, race, creed. END
BEGIN NOW What anagrams had he made on his name in youth? END
BEGIN NOW Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M. END
BEGIN NOW P. END
BEGIN NOW What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic END

BEGIN NOW What relation existed between their ages? END

BEGIN NOW was 6. END
BEGIN NOW 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present END
BEGIN NOW age Bloom would be 54. END
BEGIN NOW In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 END
BEGIN NOW their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 END
BEGIN NOW 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according END
BEGIN NOW as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in END

BEGIN NOW have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in END
BEGIN NOW the year 81,396 B.C. END
BEGIN NOW What events might nullify these calculations? END
BEGIN NOW The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new END
BEGIN NOW era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent END
BEGIN NOW extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. END
BEGIN NOW How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina END
BEGIN NOW Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's END
BEGIN NOW mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his END

BEGIN NOW The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a END
BEGIN NOW rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father END
BEGIN NOW and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older. END
BEGIN NOW Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and END
BEGIN NOW afterwards seconded by the father? END
BEGIN NOW Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative END
BEGIN NOW gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined. END
BEGIN NOW Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a END
BEGIN NOW third connecting link between them? END
BEGIN NOW Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the END
BEGIN NOW house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and END
BEGIN NOW had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms END
BEGIN NOW Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts END
BEGIN NOW of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom END
BEGIN NOW who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the END
BEGIN NOW employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of END
BEGIN NOW sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road. END
BEGIN NOW Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? END
BEGIN NOW He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow END
BEGIN NOW of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with END
BEGIN NOW slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North END
BEGIN NOW Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had END
BEGIN NOW remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular END
BEGIN NOW fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles END
BEGIN NOW equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, END
BEGIN NOW private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from END
BEGIN NOW the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa. END
BEGIN NOW Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? END
BEGIN NOW Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of END
BEGIN NOW bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with END
BEGIN NOW continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, END
BEGIN NOW velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round END
BEGIN NOW and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe. END
BEGIN NOW What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years END
BEGIN NOW deceased? END
BEGIN NOW The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her END
BEGIN NOW suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient END
BEGIN NOW catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue END
BEGIN NOW of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles END
BEGIN NOW Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers. END
BEGIN NOW Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation END
BEGIN NOW which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the END
BEGIN NOW more desirable? END
BEGIN NOW The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently END
BEGIN NOW abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How to END
BEGIN NOW Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in END
BEGIN NOW sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in END
BEGIN NOW front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of END
BEGIN NOW muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant END
BEGIN NOW relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility. END
BEGIN NOW Had any special agility been his in earlier youth? END
BEGIN NOW Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full END
BEGIN NOW circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had END
BEGIN NOW excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever END
BEGIN NOW movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed END
BEGIN NOW abdominal muscles. END
BEGIN NOW Did either openly allude to their racial difference? END
BEGIN NOW Neither. END
BEGIN NOW What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts END
BEGIN NOW about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen's thoughts about END
BEGIN NOW Bloom's thoughts about Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he END
BEGIN NOW knew that he knew that he was not. END
BEGIN NOW What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective END
BEGIN NOW parentages? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently END
BEGIN NOW Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and END
BEGIN NOW Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born END
BEGIN NOW Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). END
BEGIN NOW Stephen, eldest surviving male END
BEGIN NOW consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, END
BEGIN NOW daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier). END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or END
BEGIN NOW layman? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. END
BEGIN NOW A., alone, in END
BEGIN NOW the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James END
BEGIN NOW O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump END
BEGIN NOW in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. END
BEGIN NOW C., in END
BEGIN NOW the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen (once) by the reverend END
BEGIN NOW Charles Malone C. END
BEGIN NOW C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, END
BEGIN NOW Rathgar. END
BEGIN NOW Did they find their educational careers similar? END
BEGIN NOW Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively END
BEGIN NOW through a dame's school and the high school. END
BEGIN NOW Substituting Bloom for END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, END
BEGIN NOW junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the END
BEGIN NOW matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the END
BEGIN NOW royal university. END
BEGIN NOW Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university END
BEGIN NOW of life? END
BEGIN NOW Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation END
BEGIN NOW had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him. END
BEGIN NOW What two temperaments did they individually represent? END
BEGIN NOW The scientific. END
BEGIN NOW The artistic. END
BEGIN NOW What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards END
BEGIN NOW applied, rather than towards pure, science? END
BEGIN NOW Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in END
BEGIN NOW a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his END
BEGIN NOW appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once END
BEGIN NOW revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting END
BEGIN NOW telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water END
BEGIN NOW siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump. END
BEGIN NOW Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of END
BEGIN NOW kindergarten? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, END
BEGIN NOW catapults. END
BEGIN NOW They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the END
BEGIN NOW twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature END
BEGIN NOW mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to END
BEGIN NOW correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, END
BEGIN NOW historically costumed dolls. END
BEGIN NOW What also stimulated him in his cogitations? END
BEGIN NOW The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. END
BEGIN NOW James, END
BEGIN NOW the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George's street, south, the latter at END
BEGIN NOW his 6 1/2d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 END

BEGIN NOW Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that END
BEGIN NOW originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably END
BEGIN NOW conduce to success? END
BEGIN NOW His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn END
BEGIN NOW by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be END
BEGIN NOW seated engaged in writing. END
BEGIN NOW What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW Solitary hotel in mountain pass. END

BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's Hotel, Queen's Hotel, Queen's END
BEGIN NOW Hotel. END
BEGIN NOW Queen's Ho... END
BEGIN NOW What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf END
BEGIN NOW Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, END
BEGIN NOW in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in END
BEGIN NOW the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment END
BEGIN NOW to I of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. END
BEGIN NOW on the END
BEGIN NOW morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 END

BEGIN NOW having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin END
BEGIN NOW aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, END
BEGIN NOW Ennis. END
BEGIN NOW Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or END
BEGIN NOW intuition? END
BEGIN NOW Coincidence. END
BEGIN NOW Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see? END
BEGIN NOW He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words END
BEGIN NOW by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament END
BEGIN NOW relieved. END
BEGIN NOW Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to END
BEGIN NOW him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The END
BEGIN NOW Parable of the Plums? END
BEGIN NOW It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by END
BEGIN NOW implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms END
BEGIN NOW (e.g. END
BEGIN NOW My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) END
BEGIN NOW composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in END

BEGIN NOW Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other END
BEGIN NOW frequently engaged his mind? END
BEGIN NOW What to do with our wives. END
BEGIN NOW What had been his hypothetical singular solutions? END
BEGIN NOW Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, END
BEGIN NOW nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, END
BEGIN NOW chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the END
BEGIN NOW policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano END
BEGIN NOW and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: END
BEGIN NOW biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as END
BEGIN NOW pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a END
BEGIN NOW cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of END
BEGIN NOW erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically END
BEGIN NOW controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and END
BEGIN NOW with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female END
BEGIN NOW acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of END
BEGIN NOW evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction END
BEGIN NOW agreeable. END
BEGIN NOW What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him END
BEGIN NOW in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution? END
BEGIN NOW In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper END
BEGIN NOW with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and END
BEGIN NOW Hebrew characters. END
BEGIN NOW She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals END
BEGIN NOW as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a END
BEGIN NOW city in Canada, Quebec. END
BEGIN NOW She understood little of political END
BEGIN NOW complications, internal, or balance of power, external. END
BEGIN NOW In calculating END
BEGIN NOW the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. END
BEGIN NOW After END
BEGIN NOW completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the END
BEGIN NOW implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the END
BEGIN NOW corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. END
BEGIN NOW Unusual END
BEGIN NOW polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false END
BEGIN NOW analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a END
BEGIN NOW mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture). END
BEGIN NOW What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and END
BEGIN NOW such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things? END
BEGIN NOW The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all END
BEGIN NOW balances, proved true by construction. END
BEGIN NOW The counterbalance of her END
BEGIN NOW proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment. END
BEGIN NOW How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance? END
BEGIN NOW Variously. END
BEGIN NOW By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a END
BEGIN NOW certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent END
BEGIN NOW knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's END
BEGIN NOW ignorant lapse. END
BEGIN NOW With what success had he attempted direct instruction? END
BEGIN NOW She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest END
BEGIN NOW comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty END
BEGIN NOW remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated END
BEGIN NOW with error. END
BEGIN NOW What system had proved more effective? END
BEGIN NOW Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest. END
BEGIN NOW Example? END
BEGIN NOW She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she END
BEGIN NOW disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new END
BEGIN NOW hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat. END
BEGIN NOW Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of END
BEGIN NOW postexilic eminence did he adduce? END
BEGIN NOW Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, END
BEGIN NOW author of More Nebukim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of END
BEGIN NOW such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there END
BEGIN NOW arose none like Moses (Maimonides). END
BEGIN NOW What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth END
BEGIN NOW seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by END
BEGIN NOW Stephen? END
BEGIN NOW That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, END
BEGIN NOW name uncertain. END
BEGIN NOW Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a END
BEGIN NOW selected or rejected race mentioned? END
BEGIN NOW Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), END
BEGIN NOW Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist). END
BEGIN NOW What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish END
BEGIN NOW languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts END
BEGIN NOW by guest to host and by host to guest? END
BEGIN NOW By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin END
BEGIN NOW (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care). END
BEGIN NOW By Bloom: Kkifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple END
BEGIN NOW amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate). END
BEGIN NOW How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages END
BEGIN NOW made in substantiation of the oral comparison? END
BEGIN NOW By juxtaposition. END
BEGIN NOW On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior END
BEGIN NOW literary style, entituled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so END
BEGIN NOW manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the END
BEGIN NOW table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish END
BEGIN NOW characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn END
BEGIN NOW wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of END
BEGIN NOW mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal END
BEGIN NOW and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100. END
BEGIN NOW Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the END
BEGIN NOW extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical? END
BEGIN NOW Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence END
BEGIN NOW and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary. END
BEGIN NOW What points of contact existed between these languages and between the END
BEGIN NOW peoples who spoke them? END
BEGIN NOW The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and END
BEGIN NOW servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been END
BEGIN NOW taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary END
BEGIN NOW instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, END
BEGIN NOW and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their END
BEGIN NOW archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, END
BEGIN NOW toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works END
BEGIN NOW of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, END
BEGIN NOW Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, END
BEGIN NOW Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the END
BEGIN NOW isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. END
BEGIN NOW Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of END
BEGIN NOW their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the END
BEGIN NOW restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish END
BEGIN NOW political autonomy or devolution. END
BEGIN NOW What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, END
BEGIN NOW ethnically irreducible consummation? END
BEGIN NOW Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich? END
BEGIN NOW In consequence of defective mnemotechnic. END
BEGIN NOW How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? END
BEGIN NOW By a periphrastic version of the general text. END
BEGIN NOW In what common study did their mutual reflections merge? END
BEGIN NOW The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic END
BEGIN NOW hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of END
BEGIN NOW modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions END
BEGIN NOW (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic). END
BEGIN NOW Did END
BEGIN NOW the guest comply with his host's request? END
BEGIN NOW Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters. END
BEGIN NOW What was Stephen's auditive sensation? END
BEGIN NOW He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation END
BEGIN NOW of the past. END
BEGIN NOW What was Bloom's visual sensation? END
BEGIN NOW He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a END
BEGIN NOW future. END
BEGIN NOW What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional END
BEGIN NOW quasisensations of concealed identities? END
BEGIN NOW Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by END
BEGIN NOW Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as END
BEGIN NOW leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair. END
BEGIN NOW Auditively, Bloom's: The END
BEGIN NOW traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe. END
BEGIN NOW What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with END
BEGIN NOW what exemplars? END
BEGIN NOW In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very END
BEGIN NOW reverend John Conmee S. END
BEGIN NOW J., the reverend T. END
BEGIN NOW Salmon, D. END
BEGIN NOW D., provost of END
BEGIN NOW Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. END
BEGIN NOW Dowie. END
BEGIN NOW At the bar, English or Irish: END
BEGIN NOW exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. END
BEGIN NOW C., Rufus Isaacs, K. END
BEGIN NOW C. END
BEGIN NOW On the stage modern END
BEGIN NOW or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian Osmond END
BEGIN NOW Tearle (died 1901), exponent of Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange END
BEGIN NOW legend on an allied theme? END
BEGIN NOW Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being END
BEGIN NOW secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid END
BEGIN NOW residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream END
BEGIN NOW plus cocoa, having been consumed. END
BEGIN NOW Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend. END
BEGIN NOW Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball. END
BEGIN NOW And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o'er the END
BEGIN NOW jew's garden wall. END
BEGIN NOW And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played END
BEGIN NOW He broke the jew's windows all. END
BEGIN NOW How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part? END
BEGIN NOW With unmixed feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Smiling, a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the END
BEGIN NOW unbroken kitchen window. END
BEGIN NOW Recite the second part (minor) of the legend. END
BEGIN NOW Then out there came the jew's daughter And she all dressed in green. END
BEGIN NOW "Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again." END
BEGIN NOW "I can't come back and I won't come back Without my schoolfellows all. END
BEGIN NOW For if my master he did hear He'd make it a sorry ball." END
BEGIN NOW She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she END
BEGIN NOW led him to a room Where none could hear him call. END
BEGIN NOW She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head. END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW now he'll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead. END
BEGIN NOW How did the father of Millicent receive this second part? END
BEGIN NOW With mixed feelings. END
BEGIN NOW Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's END
BEGIN NOW daughter, all dressed in green. END
BEGIN NOW Condense Stephen's commentary. END
BEGIN NOW One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. END
BEGIN NOW Once by END
BEGIN NOW inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. END
BEGIN NOW It comes when he END
BEGIN NOW is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope END
BEGIN NOW and youth, holds him unresisting. END
BEGIN NOW It leads him to a strange habitation, END
BEGIN NOW to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, END
BEGIN NOW consenting. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (victim predestined) sad? END
BEGIN NOW He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him END
BEGIN NOW should by him not be told. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still? END
BEGIN NOW In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy. END
BEGIN NOW Why was the host (secret infidel) silent? END
BEGIN NOW He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the END
BEGIN NOW incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the END
BEGIN NOW propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of END
BEGIN NOW opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of END
BEGIN NOW atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, END
BEGIN NOW hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism. END
BEGIN NOW From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not END
BEGIN NOW totally immune? END
BEGIN NOW From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his END
BEGIN NOW sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an END
BEGIN NOW indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. END
BEGIN NOW From END
BEGIN NOW somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled END
BEGIN NOW in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its END
BEGIN NOW destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, END
BEGIN NOW sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member END
BEGIN NOW of his family? END
BEGIN NOW Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent END
BEGIN NOW (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation END
BEGIN NOW of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night END
BEGIN NOW attire with a vacant mute expression. END
BEGIN NOW What other infantile memories had he of her? END
BEGIN NOW 15 June 1889. END
BEGIN NOW A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and END
BEGIN NOW lessen congestion. END
BEGIN NOW A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks END

BEGIN NOW What endemic characteristics were present? END
BEGIN NOW Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line END
BEGIN NOW of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant END
BEGIN NOW intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals. END
BEGIN NOW What memories had he of her adolescence? END
BEGIN NOW She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. END
BEGIN NOW On the duke's lawn, END
BEGIN NOW entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and END
BEGIN NOW take away her photographic image (objection not stated). END
BEGIN NOW On the South END
BEGIN NOW Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual END
BEGIN NOW of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned END
BEGIN NOW abruptly back (reason of change not stated). END
BEGIN NOW On the vigil of the 15th END
BEGIN NOW anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county END
BEGIN NOW Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year END
BEGIN NOW not stated). END
BEGIN NOW Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him? END
BEGIN NOW Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped. END
BEGIN NOW What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, END
BEGIN NOW if differently? END
BEGIN NOW A temporary departure of his cat. END
BEGIN NOW Why similarly, why differently? END
BEGIN NOW Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male END
BEGIN NOW (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). END
BEGIN NOW Differently, END
BEGIN NOW because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the END
BEGIN NOW habitation. END
BEGIN NOW In other respects were their differences similar? END
BEGIN NOW In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in END
BEGIN NOW unexpectedness. END
BEGIN NOW As? END
BEGIN NOW Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it END
BEGIN NOW for her (cf neckarching cat). END
BEGIN NOW Moreover, on the free surface of the lake END
BEGIN NOW in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented END
BEGIN NOW spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the END
BEGIN NOW constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf END
BEGIN NOW mousewatching cat). END
BEGIN NOW Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences END
BEGIN NOW of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf END
BEGIN NOW earwashing cat). END
BEGIN NOW Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an END
BEGIN NOW unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been END
BEGIN NOW Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it END
BEGIN NOW (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). END
BEGIN NOW Hence, in END
BEGIN NOW passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, END
BEGIN NOW their differences were similar. END
BEGIN NOW In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as END
BEGIN NOW matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her? END
BEGIN NOW As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous END
BEGIN NOW animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of END

BEGIN NOW In what manners did she reciprocate? END
BEGIN NOW She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to END
BEGIN NOW him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware. END
BEGIN NOW She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had END
BEGIN NOW been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his END
BEGIN NOW necessities, anticipating his desires. END
BEGIN NOW She admired: a natural phenomenon END
BEGIN NOW having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire END
BEGIN NOW to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the END
BEGIN NOW moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part. END
BEGIN NOW What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make END
BEGIN NOW to Stephen, noctambulist? END
BEGIN NOW To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and END
BEGIN NOW Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately END
BEGIN NOW above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of END
BEGIN NOW his host and hostess. END
BEGIN NOW What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation END
BEGIN NOW of such an extemporisation? END
BEGIN NOW For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. END
BEGIN NOW For the END
BEGIN NOW host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW For the END
BEGIN NOW hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian END
BEGIN NOW pronunciation. END
BEGIN NOW Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a END
BEGIN NOW hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent END
BEGIN NOW eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's END
BEGIN NOW daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother END
BEGIN NOW through daughter. END
BEGIN NOW To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest END
BEGIN NOW return a monosyllabic negative answer? END
BEGIN NOW If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney END
BEGIN NOW Parade railway station, 14 October 1903. END
BEGIN NOW What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the END
BEGIN NOW host? END
BEGIN NOW A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment END
BEGIN NOW of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the END
BEGIN NOW anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag). END
BEGIN NOW Was the proposal of asylum accepted? END
BEGIN NOW Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined. END
BEGIN NOW What exchange of money took place between host and guest? END
BEGIN NOW The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (1- END
BEGIN NOW 7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the END
BEGIN NOW former. END
BEGIN NOW What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, END
BEGIN NOW declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed? END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the END
BEGIN NOW residence of the instructed. END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a course of vocal END
BEGIN NOW instruction, place the residence of the instructress. END
BEGIN NOW To inaugurate a END
BEGIN NOW series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, END
BEGIN NOW places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in END
BEGIN NOW the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. END
BEGIN NOW and END
BEGIN NOW E. END
BEGIN NOW Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare END
BEGIN NOW street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a END
BEGIN NOW public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two END
BEGIN NOW or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line END
BEGIN NOW drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in END
BEGIN NOW different places). END
BEGIN NOW What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually END
BEGIN NOW selfexcluding propositions? END
BEGIN NOW The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert END
BEGIN NOW Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive END
BEGIN NOW particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring END
BEGIN NOW to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had END
BEGIN NOW publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his END
BEGIN NOW (the clown's) papa. END
BEGIN NOW The imprevidibility of the future: once in the END
BEGIN NOW summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches END
BEGIN NOW on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and END
BEGIN NOW received by J. END
BEGIN NOW and T. END
BEGIN NOW Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand END
BEGIN NOW Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, END
BEGIN NOW circuitous or direct, return. END
BEGIN NOW Was the clown Bloom's son? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Had Bloom's coin returned? END
BEGIN NOW Never. END
BEGIN NOW Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him? END
BEGIN NOW Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to END
BEGIN NOW amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and END
BEGIN NOW international animosity. END
BEGIN NOW He believed then that human life was infinitely END
BEGIN NOW perfectible, eliminating these conditions? END
BEGIN NOW There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct END
BEGIN NOW from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of END
BEGIN NOW destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of END
BEGIN NOW the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and END
BEGIN NOW death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human END
BEGIN NOW females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable END
BEGIN NOW accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies END
BEGIN NOW and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital END
BEGIN NOW criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make END
BEGIN NOW terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of END
BEGIN NOW which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital END
BEGIN NOW growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through END
BEGIN NOW maturity to decay. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he desist from speculation? END
BEGIN NOW Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other END
BEGIN NOW more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena END
BEGIN NOW to be removed. END
BEGIN NOW Did Stephen participate in his dejection? END
BEGIN NOW He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding END
BEGIN NOW syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational END
BEGIN NOW reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the END
BEGIN NOW incertitude of the void. END
BEGIN NOW Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom? END
BEGIN NOW Not verbally. END
BEGIN NOW Substantially. END
BEGIN NOW What comforted his misapprehension? END
BEGIN NOW That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from END
BEGIN NOW the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. END
BEGIN NOW In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus END
BEGIN NOW from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected? END
BEGIN NOW Lighted Candle in Stick borne by END
BEGIN NOW BLOOM END
BEGIN NOW Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by END
BEGIN NOW STEPHEN: END
BEGIN NOW With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm? END
BEGIN NOW The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israel de Egypto: domus Jacob de END
BEGIN NOW populo barbaro. END
BEGIN NOW What did each do at the door of egress? END
BEGIN NOW Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Stephen put the hat on his head. END
BEGIN NOW For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress? END
BEGIN NOW For a cat. END
BEGIN NOW What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the END
BEGIN NOW guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from END
BEGIN NOW the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden? END
BEGIN NOW The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. END
BEGIN NOW With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his END
BEGIN NOW companion of various constellations? END
BEGIN NOW Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in END
BEGIN NOW incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous END
BEGIN NOW scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an END
BEGIN NOW observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft END
BEGIN NOW deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius END
BEGIN NOW (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant END
BEGIN NOW and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the END
BEGIN NOW precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and END
BEGIN NOW nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund END
BEGIN NOW and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging END
BEGIN NOW towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic END
BEGIN NOW drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from END
BEGIN NOW immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with END
BEGIN NOW which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a END
BEGIN NOW parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity. END
BEGIN NOW Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast? END
BEGIN NOW Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the END
BEGIN NOW earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed END
BEGIN NOW in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, END
BEGIN NOW of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable END
BEGIN NOW trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained END
BEGIN NOW by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe END
BEGIN NOW of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves END
BEGIN NOW universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in END
BEGIN NOW continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was END
BEGIN NOW again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends END
BEGIN NOW and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the END
BEGIN NOW progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached. END
BEGIN NOW Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result? END
BEGIN NOW Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of END
BEGIN NOW the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number END
BEGIN NOW computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of END
BEGIN NOW so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the END
BEGIN NOW result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages END
BEGIN NOW each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be END
BEGIN NOW requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed END
BEGIN NOW integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, END
BEGIN NOW hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, END
BEGIN NOW billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series END
BEGIN NOW containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost END
BEGIN NOW kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers. END
BEGIN NOW Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their END
BEGIN NOW satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and END
BEGIN NOW moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution? END
BEGIN NOW Of a different order of difficulty. END
BEGIN NOW Conscious that the human organism, END
BEGIN NOW normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when END
BEGIN NOW elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere END
BEGIN NOW suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the END
BEGIN NOW line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was END
BEGIN NOW approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, END
BEGIN NOW when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a END
BEGIN NOW working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more END
BEGIN NOW adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might END
BEGIN NOW subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, END
BEGIN NOW Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an END
BEGIN NOW apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite END
BEGIN NOW differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would END
BEGIN NOW probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to END
BEGIN NOW vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity. END
BEGIN NOW And the problem of possible redemption? END
BEGIN NOW The minor was proved by the END
BEGIN NOW major. END
BEGIN NOW Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered? END
BEGIN NOW The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, END
BEGIN NOW yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: END
BEGIN NOW their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: END
BEGIN NOW the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular END
BEGIN NOW cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the END
BEGIN NOW interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous END
BEGIN NOW discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, END
BEGIN NOW Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of END
BEGIN NOW distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite END
BEGIN NOW compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive END
BEGIN NOW and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of END
BEGIN NOW meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth END
BEGIN NOW of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers END
BEGIN NOW about the period of the feast of S. END
BEGIN NOW Lawrence (martyr, lo August): the END
BEGIN NOW monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: END
BEGIN NOW the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a END
BEGIN NOW star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day END
BEGIN NOW (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in END
BEGIN NOW incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth END
BEGIN NOW of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting END
BEGIN NOW constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar END
BEGIN NOW origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared END
BEGIN NOW from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of END
BEGIN NOW the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar END
BEGIN NOW origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared END
BEGIN NOW from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of END
BEGIN NOW Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years END
BEGIN NOW after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from END
BEGIN NOW other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of END
BEGIN NOW other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, END
BEGIN NOW from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, END
BEGIN NOW taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular END
BEGIN NOW animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, END
BEGIN NOW pallor of human beings. END
BEGIN NOW His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing END
BEGIN NOW for possible error? END
BEGIN NOW That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a END
BEGIN NOW heavenman. END
BEGIN NOW That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the END
BEGIN NOW known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the END
BEGIN NOW suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of END
BEGIN NOW different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, END
BEGIN NOW remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a END
BEGIN NOW present before its probable spectators had entered actual present END
BEGIN NOW existence. END
BEGIN NOW Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? END
BEGIN NOW Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the END
BEGIN NOW delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection END
BEGIN NOW invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the END
BEGIN NOW satellite of their planet. END
BEGIN NOW Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological END
BEGIN NOW influences upon sublunary disasters? END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the END
BEGIN NOW nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to END
BEGIN NOW verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the END
BEGIN NOW sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity. END
BEGIN NOW What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and END
BEGIN NOW woman? END
BEGIN NOW Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian END
BEGIN NOW generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her END
BEGIN NOW luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and END
BEGIN NOW setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced END
BEGIN NOW invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative END
BEGIN NOW interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power END
BEGIN NOW to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to END
BEGIN NOW incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her END
BEGIN NOW visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent END
BEGIN NOW propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her END
BEGIN NOW light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her END
BEGIN NOW arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, END
BEGIN NOW when invisible. END
BEGIN NOW What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's, END
BEGIN NOW gaze? END
BEGIN NOW In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a END
BEGIN NOW paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller END
BEGIN NOW blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving END
BEGIN NOW shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street. END
BEGIN NOW How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his END
BEGIN NOW wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp? END
BEGIN NOW With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued END
BEGIN NOW affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with END
BEGIN NOW suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW Both then were silent? END
BEGIN NOW Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal END
BEGIN NOW flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. END
BEGIN NOW Were they indefinitely inactive? END
BEGIN NOW At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, END
BEGIN NOW then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs END
BEGIN NOW of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, END
BEGIN NOW their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected END
BEGIN NOW luminous and semiluminous shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Similarly? END
BEGIN NOW The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations END
BEGIN NOW were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of END
BEGIN NOW the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year END
BEGIN NOW at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of END
BEGIN NOW greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the END
BEGIN NOW institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the END
BEGIN NOW ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption END
BEGIN NOW an insistent vesical pressure. END
BEGIN NOW What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the END
BEGIN NOW invisible audible collateral organ of the other? END
BEGIN NOW To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, END
BEGIN NOW reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity. END
BEGIN NOW To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised END
BEGIN NOW (I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from END
BEGIN NOW unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine END
BEGIN NOW prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic END
BEGIN NOW church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of END
BEGIN NOW the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine END
BEGIN NOW excrescences as hair and toenails. END
BEGIN NOW What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed? END
BEGIN NOW A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament END
BEGIN NOW from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress END
BEGIN NOW of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo. END
BEGIN NOW How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal END
BEGIN NOW departer? END
BEGIN NOW By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an END
BEGIN NOW unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and END
BEGIN NOW turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its END
BEGIN NOW staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and END
BEGIN NOW revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress. END
BEGIN NOW How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation? END
BEGIN NOW Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its END
BEGIN NOW base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and END
BEGIN NOW forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. END
BEGIN NOW What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their END
BEGIN NOW (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands? END
BEGIN NOW The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells END
BEGIN NOW in the church of Saint George. END
BEGIN NOW What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard? END
BEGIN NOW By Stephen: END
BEGIN NOW Liliata rutilantium. END
BEGIN NOW Turma circumdet. END
BEGIN NOW Iubilantium te virginum. END
BEGIN NOW Chorus END
BEGIN NOW excipiat. END
BEGIN NOW By Bloom: END
BEGIN NOW Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho. END
BEGIN NOW Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day END
BEGIN NOW at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south END
BEGIN NOW to Glasnevin in the north? END
BEGIN NOW Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), END
BEGIN NOW Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John END
BEGIN NOW Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), END
BEGIN NOW Paddy Dignam (in the grave). END
BEGIN NOW Alone, what did Bloom hear? END
BEGIN NOW The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the END
BEGIN NOW double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane. END
BEGIN NOW Alone, what did Bloom feel? END
BEGIN NOW The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing END
BEGIN NOW point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or RÃ©aumur: the END
BEGIN NOW incipient intimations of proximate dawn. END
BEGIN NOW Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind END
BEGIN NOW him? END
BEGIN NOW Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy END
BEGIN NOW Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, END
BEGIN NOW Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. END
BEGIN NOW Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin END
BEGIN NOW Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, END
BEGIN NOW Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount). END
BEGIN NOW What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain? END
BEGIN NOW The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the END
BEGIN NOW apparition of a new solar disk. END
BEGIN NOW Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena? END
BEGIN NOW Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house END
BEGIN NOW of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of END
BEGIN NOW the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the END
BEGIN NOW direction of Mizrach, the east. END
BEGIN NOW He remembered the initial paraphenomena? END
BEGIN NOW More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at END
BEGIN NOW various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, END
BEGIN NOW the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the END
BEGIN NOW first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. END
BEGIN NOW Did he remain? END
BEGIN NOW With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering END
BEGIN NOW the passage, reclosing the door. END
BEGIN NOW With brief suspiration he reassumed the END
BEGIN NOW candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, END
BEGIN NOW hallfloor, and reentered. END
BEGIN NOW What suddenly arrested his ingress? END
BEGIN NOW The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into END
BEGIN NOW contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible END
BEGIN NOW fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in END
BEGIN NOW consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. END
BEGIN NOW Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of END
BEGIN NOW furniture. END
BEGIN NOW A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite END
BEGIN NOW the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an END
BEGIN NOW alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and END
BEGIN NOW white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the END
BEGIN NOW door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard END
BEGIN NOW (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had END
BEGIN NOW been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but END
BEGIN NOW more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved END
BEGIN NOW from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied END
BEGIN NOW by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. END
BEGIN NOW Describe them. END
BEGIN NOW One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back END
BEGIN NOW slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an END
BEGIN NOW irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply END
BEGIN NOW upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. END
BEGIN NOW The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed END
BEGIN NOW directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat END
BEGIN NOW to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of END
BEGIN NOW white plaited rush. END
BEGIN NOW What significances attached to these two chairs? END
BEGIN NOW Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial END
BEGIN NOW evidence, of testimonial supermanence. END
BEGIN NOW What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard? END
BEGIN NOW A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin END
BEGIN NOW supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray END
BEGIN NOW containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two END
BEGIN NOW discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in END
BEGIN NOW the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words END
BEGIN NOW by G. END
BEGIN NOW Clifton Bingham, composed by J. END
BEGIN NOW L. END
BEGIN NOW Molloy, sung by Madam END
BEGIN NOW Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad END
BEGIN NOW libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close. END
BEGIN NOW With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects? END
BEGIN NOW With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right END
BEGIN NOW temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a END
BEGIN NOW large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, END
BEGIN NOW bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, END

BEGIN NOW What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive END

BEGIN NOW sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses END
BEGIN NOW of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the END
BEGIN NOW face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison. END
BEGIN NOW Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse? END
BEGIN NOW Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain END
BEGIN NOW beliefs and practices. END
BEGIN NOW As? END
BEGIN NOW The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the END
BEGIN NOW hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete END
BEGIN NOW mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male END
BEGIN NOW infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the END
BEGIN NOW ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath. END
BEGIN NOW How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him? END
BEGIN NOW Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than END
BEGIN NOW other beliefs and practices now appeared. END
BEGIN NOW What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)? END
BEGIN NOW Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a END
BEGIN NOW retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between END

BEGIN NOW statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, END
BEGIN NOW empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having END
BEGIN NOW taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). END
BEGIN NOW Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant END
BEGIN NOW consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by END
BEGIN NOW suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the END
BEGIN NOW various centres mentioned. END
BEGIN NOW Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these END
BEGIN NOW migrations in narrator and listener? END

BEGIN NOW What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent? END
BEGIN NOW The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon END
BEGIN NOW repletion. END
BEGIN NOW What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences? END

BEGIN NOW possession of scrip. END
BEGIN NOW Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which END
BEGIN NOW these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values END
BEGIN NOW to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity. END

BEGIN NOW Nadir of END
BEGIN NOW misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic END

BEGIN NOW With which attendant indignities? END
BEGIN NOW The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the END

BEGIN NOW simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of END
BEGIN NOW illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of END
BEGIN NOW decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less END
BEGIN NOW than nothing. END
BEGIN NOW By what could such a situation be precluded? END
BEGIN NOW By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place). END
BEGIN NOW Which preferably? END
BEGIN NOW The latter, by the line of least resistance. END
BEGIN NOW What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable? END
BEGIN NOW Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. END
BEGIN NOW The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. END
BEGIN NOW The necessity END
BEGIN NOW to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest. END
BEGIN NOW What considerations rendered departure not irrational? END
BEGIN NOW The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which END
BEGIN NOW being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if END
BEGIN NOW not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, END
BEGIN NOW which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting END
BEGIN NOW parties, which was impossible. END
BEGIN NOW What considerations rendered departure desirable? END
BEGIN NOW The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as END

BEGIN NOW Somewhere END
BEGIN NOW imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey END

BEGIN NOW Whence, disappearing from the constellation of END

BEGIN NOW return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark END
BEGIN NOW crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) END
BEGIN NOW surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king. END
BEGIN NOW What would render such return irrational? END
BEGIN NOW An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through END
BEGIN NOW reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible END
BEGIN NOW time. END
BEGIN NOW What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable? END
BEGIN NOW The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of END
